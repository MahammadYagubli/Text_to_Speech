1.1 Working capital characteristics of different businesses
Different businesses will have different working capital characteristics. There are three main aspects to
these differences.
(a)

Holding inventory (from their purchase from external suppliers, through the production and
warehousing of finished goods, up to the time of sale)

(b)

Taking time to pay suppliers and other accounts payable (creditors)

(c)

Allowing customers (accounts receivable) time to pay

Here are some examples.

Exam focus
point

(a)

Supermarkets and other retailers receive much of their sales in cash or by credit card or debit card.
However, they typically buy from suppliers on credit. They may therefore have the advantage of
significant cash holdings, which they may choose to invest.

(b)

A company which supplies to other companies, such as a wholesaler, is likely to be selling and
buying mainly on credit. Co-ordinating the flow of cash may be quite a problem. Such a company
may make use of short-term borrowings (such as an overdraft) to manage its cash.

(c)

Smaller companies with a limited trading record may face particularly severe problems. Lacking a
long track record, such companies may find it difficult to obtain credit from suppliers. At the same
time, customers will expect to receive the length of credit period that is normal for the particular
business concerned. The firm may find itself squeezed in its management of cash.

Some aspect of working capital management is likely to be included in every exam.

2 Objectives of working capital management
FAST FORWARD

12/14, 9/16

The two main objectives of working capital management are to ensure that it has sufficient liquid
resources to continue in business and to increase its profitability.
Every business needs adequate liquid resources to maintain day to day cash flow such as wages and
payments to suppliers.
Liquidity can be maintained by ensuring that the amounts of cash tied up in inventory and receivables is
not excessive.
However, if a business dramatically cut its inventory and receivables (ie adopts an aggressive approach to
working capital management) then this may lead to trading problems, and lower profits. Here are some
examples of problems from having levels of working capital that are too low.
(a)

Low inventory may mean that delivery lead times to customers are excessively high, or that a
business does not have enough inventory to meet peaks in demand. This is likely to lead to lost
sales.

(b)

Having low receivables implies that a business's credit terms are stringent and that long credit
periods are not being made available to its customers. Again, in some industries, this may lead to
lost sales.

So, the objectives of liquidity and profitability may conflict.
However, if the levels of inventory and receivables are high because working capital is not being managed
well, then more professional management of the warehouse (to keep inventory lower) and of credit control
(to keep receivables lower) may allow both higher liquidity and higher profitability.
So, the objectives of liquidity and profitability are not always in conflict.

3 Role of working capital management
FAST FORWARD

A business needs to have clear policies for the management of each component of working capital.
Working capital management is a key factor in an organisation's long-term success. A business must
therefore have clear policies for the management of each component of working capital. The management
of cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other means of short-term
financing is the direct responsibility of the financial manager and it requires continuous day to day
supervision.

Question

Working capital policies

What differences would there be in working capital policies for a manufacturing company and a food
retailer?

Answer
The manufacturing company will need to invest heavily in spare parts and may be owed large amounts of
money by its customers. The food retailer will have a large inventory of goods for resale but will have
low/no accounts receivable.
The manufacturing company will therefore need a carefully considered policy on the management of
accounts receivable which will need to reflect the credit policies of its close competitors.
The food retailer will be more concerned with inventory management.

4 The cash operating cycle
Key term

12/14, 9/16, 12/16, Mar/June 17

The cash operating cycle is the period of time which elapses between the point at which cash begins to be
expended on the production of a product and the collection of cash from a customer.
The connection between investment in working capital and cash flow may be illustrated by means of the
cash operating cycle (also called the working capital cycle, trading cycle or cash conversion cycle).
The cash operating cycle in a manufacturing business equals:
The average time that raw materials remain in inventory
Less the time taken to pay suppliers (ie period of credit taken from suppliers)
Plus the time taken to produce the goods
Plus the time taken by customers to pay for the goods
Cash cycle

Months
X
X
X
X
X

If the turnover periods for inventories and accounts receivable lengthen (ie inventories and receivables
levels increase), or the payment period to accounts payable shortens (ie payables level falls), then the
cash operating cycle will lengthen and the investment in working capital will increase.
The length of the cash operating cycle is often dictated by the industry. For example, a construction
business may have a long cash operating cycle because of the high level of work in progress. Restaurant
businesses usually have short cash operating cycles because they have short inventory periods and
customers pay by cash or debit or credit card.
Note also that it is possible to have a negative cash operating cycle. The bookseller and retailer Amazon
has a negative cash operating cycle because of short inventory periods and fast payments from
customers. When Amazon ships a book, for example, it charges the customer's credit card and gets paid
by the credit card company within a day.

4.1 Example: Cash operating cycle
Wines Co buys raw materials from suppliers that allow Wines 2.5 months' credit. The raw materials
remain in inventory for one month, and it takes Wines two months to produce the goods. The goods are
sold within a couple of days of production being completed and customers take on average 1.5 months to
pay.

5 Liquidity ratios
FAST FORWARD

12/14, Mar/Jun 17

Working capital ratios may help to indicate whether a company is over-capitalised, with excessive
working capital, or if a business is likely to fail. A business which is trying to do too much too quickly with
too little long-term capital is overtrading.

5.1 The current ratio
The current ratio is the standard test of liquidity.

Formula to
learn

Current ratio =

Current assets
Current liabilities

A company should have enough current assets that give a promise of 'cash to come' to meet its
commitments to pay its current liabilities. Superficially, a ratio in excess of 1 implies that the organisation
has enough cash and near-cash assets to satisfy its immediate liabilities. However, interpretation needs to
be conducted with care. Too high a ratio implies that too much cash may be tied up in receivables and
inventories. What is 'comfortable' varies between different types of business.
Part C Working capital management
w

4: Working capital

83

5.2 The quick ratio
Formula to
learn

Quick ratio or acid test ratio =

Current assets less inventories
Current liabilities

Companies are unable to convert all their current assets into cash very quickly. In some businesses where
inventory turnover is slow, most inventories are not very liquid assets, and the cash cycle is long. For these
reasons, we calculate an additional liquidity ratio, known as the quick ratio or acid test ratio.
This ratio should ideally be at least 1 for companies with a slow inventory turnover. For companies with a
fast inventory turnover, a quick ratio can be less than 1 without suggesting that the company is in cash
flow difficulties.

5.3 The accounts receivable payment period
Formula to
learn

Accounts receivable days or accounts receivable payment period, or average collection period =
Trade receivables
365 days
Credit sales revenue
This is a rough measure of the average length of time it takes for a company's accounts receivable to pay
what they owe.
The trade accounts receivable are not the total figure for accounts receivable in the statement of financial
position, which includes prepayments and non-trade accounts receivable. The trade accounts receivable
figure will be itemised in an analysis of the total accounts receivable, in a note to the accounts.
The estimate of accounts receivable days is only approximate.
(a)

The statement of financial position value of accounts receivable might be abnormally high or low
compared with the 'normal' level the company usually has. This may apply especially to smaller
companies, where the size of year-end accounts receivable may largely depend on whether a few or
even a single large customer pay just before or just after the year end.

(b)

Revenue (turnover) in the statement of profit or loss excludes sales tax, but the accounts
receivable figure in the statement of financial position includes sales tax. We are not strictly
comparing like with like. In addition, accounts receivable from the statement of financial position is
at a point and may not be typical.

5.4 The inventory turnover period
Formulae to
learn

3/17

Cost of sales
Average inventory
The inventory turnover period can also be calculated:
Average inventory
Inventory turnover period (finished goods) =
365 days
Cost of sales
Average raw materials inventory
Raw materials inventory holding period =
365 days
Annual purchases
Average WIP
Average production (work-in-progress) period =
365 days
Cost of sales
Inventory turnover =

These indicate the average number of days that items of inventory are held for. As with the average
accounts receivable collection period, these are only approximate figures, but ones which should be
reliable enough for finding changes over time. Average inventory is often calculated as (opening + closing
balance)/2 although other methods of estimating a typical value may be used.
A lengthening inventory turnover period indicates:

84

(a)

A slowdown in trading, or

(b)

A build-up in inventory levels, perhaps suggesting that the investment in inventories is becoming
excessive

4: Working capital

Part C Working capital management
w


If we add together the inventory days and the accounts receivable days, this should give us an indication of
how soon inventory is convertible into cash, thereby giving a further indication of the company's liquidity.

5.5 The accounts payable payment period
Key term

Accounts payable payment period =

Average trade payables
Purchases or Cost of sales

365 days

The accounts payable payment period often helps to assess a company's liquidity; an increase in accounts
payable days is often a sign of lack of long-term finance or poor management of current assets, resulting
in the use of extended credit from suppliers, increased bank overdraft, and so on.
All the ratios calculated above will vary by industry; hence comparisons of ratios calculated with other
similar companies in the same industry are important.
You may need to use the following periods to calculate the operating cycle.
Raw materials inventory holding period
Accounts payable payment period
Average production period

Accounts receivable payment period
Operating cycle

5.6 The sales revenue/net working capital ratio
The ratio of

Sales revenue
Receivables + Inventory – Payables
This shows the level of working capital (excluding cash) required to support sales. For example if this ratio
was 5, then for every $5 increase in sales an extra $1 of cash is required to finance the required increase
in net working capital.

Exam focus
point

The ACCA examining team have confirmed that if cash is included in this calculation (which would follow
the normal interpretation of the term 'net' working capital) then students will not be penalised.

5.7 The need for funds for investment in current assets
These liquidity ratios are a guide to the risk of cash flow problems and insolvency. If a company suddenly
finds that it is unable to renew its short-term liabilities (for example, if the bank suspends its overdraft
facilities), there will be a danger of insolvency unless the company is able to turn enough of its current
assets into cash quickly.
Current liabilities are often a cheap method of finance (trade accounts payable do not usually carry an
interest cost). Companies may therefore consider that, in the interest of higher profits, it is worth
accepting some risk of insolvency by increasing current liabilities, taking the maximum credit possible
from suppliers.

5.8 Working capital needs of different types of business
Different industries have different optimum working capital profiles, reflecting their methods of doing
business and what they are selling.
(a)

Businesses with a lot of cash sales and few credit sales should have minimal accounts
receivable.

Part C Working capital management
w

4: Working capital

85

(b)

(c)

(d)

Businesses that exist solely to trade will only have finished goods in inventory, whereas
manufacturers will have raw materials and work in progress as well. In addition, some finished
goods, notably foodstuffs, have to be sold within a few days because of their perishable nature.
Large companies may be able to use their strength as customers to obtain extended credit
periods from their suppliers. By contrast small companies, particularly those that have recently
started trading, may be required to pay their suppliers immediately.
Some businesses will be receiving most of their monies at certain times of the year, while
incurring expenses throughout the year. Examples include travel agents who will have peaks
reflecting demand for holidays during the summer and at Christmas.

5.9 Over-capitalisation and working capital
If there are excessive inventories, accounts receivable and cash, and very few accounts payable, there will
be an overinvestment by the company in current assets. Working capital will be excessive and the
company in this respect will be over-capitalised.
Indicators of over-capitalisation

Sales/working capital

Compare with previous years or similar companies. A low or falling
ratio may indicate over-capitalisation.

Liquidity ratios

Compare with previous years or similar companies.

Turnover periods

Long turnover periods for inventory and accounts receivable or short
credit period from suppliers may be unnecessary. Working capital
requirements can be reduced by improving these turnover times.

(a)

The company is a manufacturing group serving the construction industry, and so would be
expected to have a comparatively lengthy accounts receivable turnover period, because of the
relatively poor cash flow in the construction industry.

(b)

The company compensates for this by ensuring that they do not pay for raw materials and other
costs before they have sold their inventories of finished goods (hence the similarity of accounts
receivable and accounts payable turnover periods).

(c)

The company's current and quick ratios have fallen but are still reasonable, and the quick ratio is
not much less than the current ratio. This suggests that inventory levels are strictly controlled,
which is reinforced by the low inventory turnover period.

(d)

The ratio of sales revenue/net working capital indicates that working capital has not increased in
line with sales. This may forecast future liquidity problems.

It would seem that working capital is tightly managed to avoid the poor liquidity which could be caused by
a high accounts receivable turnover period and comparatively high accounts payable. However, revenue
has increased but net working capital has declined due in part to the fall in short-term investments and the
increase in loans and overdrafts.

performance against what could be expected using financial analysis, including ratio analysis.

5.11 Overtrading

12/14, Mar/June 16

In contrast with over-capitalisation, overtrading happens when a business tries to do too much too quickly
with too little long-term capital, so that it is trying to support too large a volume of trade with the capital
resources at its disposal. For this reason overtrading is sometimes referred to as under-capitalisation.
Even if an overtrading business operates at a profit, it could easily run into serious trouble because it is
short of cash. Such liquidity troubles stem from the fact that it does not have enough capital to provide
the cash to pay its debts as they fall due.
Symptoms of overtrading are as follows.
(a)

There is a rapid increase in sales revenue.

(b)

There is a rapid increase in the volume of current assets and possibly also non-current assets.
Inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover might slow down, in which case the rate of
increase in inventories and accounts receivable would be even greater than the rate of increase in
sales.

Part C Working capital management
w

4: Working capital

87

(c)

(d)

Exam focus
point

There is only a small increase in equity capital (perhaps through retained profits). Most of the
increase in assets is financed by credit, especially:
(i)

Trade accounts payable – the payment period to accounts payable is likely to lengthen

(ii)

A bank overdraft, which often reaches or even exceeds the limit of the facilities agreed by
the bank

Some debt ratios and liquidity ratios alter dramatically.
(i)

The proportion of total assets financed by proprietors' capital falls, and the proportion
financed by credit rises.

(ii)

The current ratio and the quick ratio fall.

(iii)

The business might have a liquid deficit; that is, an excess of current liabilities over current
assets.

This list of symptoms is important; you must be aware of why businesses run into financial difficulties. In
the exam you might be expected to diagnose overtrading from information given about a company.

5.12 Example: Overtrading
Great Ambition Co appoints a new managing director who has great plans to expand the company. They
want to increase revenue by 100% within two years, and to do this they employ extra sales staff. They
recognise that customers do not want to have to wait for deliveries, and so they decide that the company
must build up its inventory levels. There is a substantial increase in the company's inventories. These are
held in additional warehouse space which is now rented. The company also buys new cars for its extra
sales representatives.
The managing director's policies are immediately successful in boosting sales, which double in just over
one year. Inventory levels are now much higher, but the company takes longer credit from its suppliers,
even though some suppliers have expressed their annoyance at the length of time they must wait for
payment. Credit terms for accounts receivable are unchanged, and so the volume of accounts receivable,
like the volume of sales, rises by 100%.
In spite of taking longer credit, the company still needs to increase its overdraft facilities with the bank,
which are raised from a limit of $40,000 to one of $80,000. The company is profitable, and retains some
profits in the business, but profit margins have fallen. Gross profit margins are lower because some
prices have been reduced to obtain extra sales. Net profit margins are lower because overhead costs are
higher. These include sales representatives' wages, car expenses and depreciation on cars, warehouse
rent and additional losses from having to write off out of date and slow-moving inventory items.

In situation (B), the company has reached its overdraft limit and has four times as many accounts
payable as in situation (A) but with only twice the sales revenue. Inventory levels are much higher, and
inventory turnover is lower.
The company is overtrading. If it had to pay its next trade account, or salaries and wages, before it
received any income, it could not do so without the bank allowing it to exceed its overdraft limit. The
company is profitable, although profit margins have fallen, and it ought to expect a prosperous future. But
if it does not sort out its cash flow and liquidity, it will not survive to enjoy future profits.
Suitable solutions to the problem would be implementing measures to reduce the degree of overtrading.
(a)

New capital from the shareholders could be injected.

(b)

Better control could be applied to inventories and accounts receivable. The company could abandon
ambitious plans for increased sales and more non-current asset purchases until the business has
had time to consolidate its position, and build up its capital base with retained profits.

A business seeking to increase its revenue too rapidly without an adequate capital base is not the only
cause of overtrading. Other causes are as follows.
(a)

When a business repays a loan, it often replaces the old loan with a new one (refinancing).
However a business might repay a loan without replacing it, with the consequence that it has less
long-term capital to finance its current level of operations.

(b)

A business might be profitable, but in a period of inflation, its retained profits might be
insufficient to pay for replacement non-current assets and inventories, which now cost more
because of inflation.

The amount tied up in working capital is equal to the value of raw materials, work in progress, finished
goods inventories and accounts receivable less accounts payable. The size of this net figure has a direct
effect on the liquidity of an organisation.

Introduction
This chapter deals with specific techniques in the management of accounts
receivable, accounts payable and inventory. These include overall credit control
policies (should the business offer credit – if so, how much and to whom), and
ensuring amounts owed are not excessive.
While working through this chapter, try not to think of accounts receivable and
accounts payable in isolation; they are part of working capital, each element of
which will have knock-on effects when there is a change in another. For
example, an increase in the credit period taken by accounts receivable will
reduce the amount of cash available to pay accounts payable and invest in
inventory.

levels. However, bulk discounts can mean that a different order quantity minimises inventory costs.
Almost every company carries inventories of some sort, even if they are only inventories of consumables
such as stationery. For a manufacturing business, inventories in the form of raw materials, work in
progress and finished goods may amount to a substantial proportion of the total assets of the business.
Some businesses attempt to control inventories on a scientific basis by balancing the costs of inventory
shortages against those of inventory holding. The 'scientific' control of inventories may be analysed into
three parts.

94

(a)

The economic order quantity (EOQ) model can be used to decide the optimum order size for
inventories which will minimise the costs of ordering inventories plus inventory holding costs.

(b)

If discounts for bulk purchases are available, it may be cheaper to buy inventories in large order
sizes so as to obtain the discounts.

(c)

Uncertainty in the demand for inventories and/or the supply lead time may lead a company to
decide to hold buffer inventories in order to reduce or eliminate the risk of 'stock-outs' (running
out of inventory).

1.1 The basic EOQ formula
Key term

9/16

The economic order quantity (EOQ) is the optimal ordering quantity for an item of inventory which will
minimise costs.
Let D = usage in units for one period (the demand)
Co = cost of placing one order
Ch = holding cost per unit of inventory for one period
Q = re-order quantity

relevant costs only

Assume that demand is constant, the lead time is constant or zero and purchase costs per unit are
constant (ie no bulk discounts).
The total annual cost of having inventory is:
(a)

Holding costs (holding cost per unit × average inventory) + ordering costs

C D
Q
Ch + 0

Q
The more orders are made each year the higher the ordering costs, but the lower the holding costs
(as less inventory is held).
(b)

The objective is to minimise T =

Ch + 0

Q

The order quantity, EOQ, which will minimise these total costs is:

Formula to
learn

EOQ =

2C0D
Ch

At the EOQ level, total holding costs per period equal the total ordering costs in the period.
The EOQ assumes that there are no bulk purchase discounts for large quantity orders; therefore
purchasing costs are the same regardless of the order quantity.

The EOQ formula will be given to you in the exam, but make sure you know what each letter represents
and how to do the calculation quickly and accurately.

1.2 Example: Economic order quantity
The demand for a commodity is 40,000 units a year, at a steady rate. It costs $20 to place an order, and
40c to hold a unit for a year. Find the order size to minimise inventory costs, the number of orders placed
each year, the length of the inventory cycle and the total costs of holding inventory for the year.

Solution
Q=

2C0D

Ch

2 20 40,000
= 2,000 units.

This means that there will be:
40,000
= 20 orders placed each year.

The inventory cycle is therefore:
52 weeks
= 2.6 weeks.
20 orders
Total costs will be (20

$20) +

2,000

40c = $800 a year.

1.3 Uncertainties in demand and lead times: a re-order level system
FAST FORWARD

Key term

Uncertainties in demand and lead times taken to fulfil orders mean that inventory will be ordered once it
reaches a re-order level (maximum usage maximum lead time).
Re-order level = maximum usage

maximum lead time.

The re-order level is the measure of inventory at which a replenishment order should be made.
(a)
(b)

If an order is placed too late, the organisation may run out of inventory, a stock-out, resulting in a
loss of sales and/or a loss of production.
If an order is placed too soon, the organisation will hold too much inventory, and inventory holding
costs will be excessive.

Use of a re-order level builds in a measure of safety inventory and minimises the risk of the organisation
running out of inventory. This is particularly important when the volume of demand or the supply lead
time are uncertain.
The average annual cost of such a safety inventory would be:
Quantity of safety inventory
(in units)

Inventory holding cost
per unit per annum

The diagram below shows how the inventory levels might fluctuate with this system. Points marked 'X'
show the re-order level at which a new order is placed. The number of units ordered each time is the EOQ.
Actual inventory levels sometimes fall below the safety inventory level, and sometimes the resupply arrives
before inventories have fallen to the safety level. On average, however, extra inventory holding will
approximate the safety inventory. The size of the safety inventory will depend on whether stock-outs
(running out of inventory) are allowed.

1.4 Maximum and buffer safety inventory levels
Key term

Maximum inventory level = re-order level + re-order quantity – (minimum usage

minimum lead time)

The maximum level acts as a warning signal to management that inventories are reaching a potentially
wasteful level.

Key term

Minimum inventory or buffer safety inventory = re-order level – (average usage

average lead time)

The buffer safety level acts as a warning to management that inventories are approaching a dangerously
low level and that stock-outs are possible.

Key term

Average inventory = buffer safety inventory +

re-order amount
2

This formula assumes that inventory levels fluctuate evenly between the buffer safety (or minimum)
inventory level and the highest possible inventory level (the amount of inventory immediately after an
order is received, safety inventory and re-order quantity).

1.5 Example: Maximum and buffer safety inventory
A company has an inventory management policy which involves ordering 50,000 units when the inventory
level falls to 15,000 units. Forecast demand to meet production requirements during the next year is
310,000 units. You should assume a 50-week year and that demand is constant throughout the year.
Orders are received two weeks after being placed with the supplier. What is the average inventory level?

Solution
Average usage per week = 310,000 units/50 weeks = 6,200 units
Average lead time

= 2 weeks

Re-order level

= 15,000 units

Buffer safety inventory

= re-order level – (average usage × average lead time)
= 15,000 – (6,200 × 2) = 2,600 units

Average inventory

= buffer safety inventory +
= 2,600 +

re-order amount
2

50,000
= 27,600 units

This approach assumes that a business wants to minimise the risk of stock-outs at all costs. In the
modern manufacturing environment stock-outs can have a disastrous effect on the production process.
If, however, you are given a question where the risk of stock-outs is assumed to be worth taking, and the
costs of stock-outs are quantified, the re-order level may not be calculated in the way described above. For
each possible re-order level, and therefore each possible level of buffer inventory, calculate:


The costs of holding buffer inventory per annum



The costs of stock-outs (Cost of one stock-out
number of orders per year)

expected number of stock-outs per order

The expected number of stock-outs per order reflects the various levels by which demand during the lead
time could exceed the re-order level.

1.6 Example: Possibility of stock-outs
If re-order level is 4 units, but there is a probability of 0.2 that demand during the lead time would be 5
units, and 0.05 that demand during the lead time would be 6 units. Then the expected number of
stock-outs = ((5 – 4) 0.2) + ((6 – 4) 0.05) = 0.3.
Note. Stock-outs are defined as the number of units not available in inventory when required.

1.7 The effect of discounts
The solution obtained from using the simple EOQ formula may need to be modified if bulk discounts (also
called quantity discounts) are available. To decide mathematically whether it would be worthwhile taking a
discount and ordering larger quantities, it is necessary to minimise:
Total purchasing costs + Ordering costs + Inventory holding costs.
The total cost will be minimised:



At the pre-discount EOQ level, so that a discount is not worthwhile; or
At the minimum order size necessary to earn the discount.

1.8 Example: Bulk discounts
The annual demand for an item of inventory is 125 units. The item costs $200 a unit to purchase, the
holding cost for one unit for one year is 15% of the unit cost and ordering costs are $300 an order. The
supplier offers a 3% discount for orders of 60 units or more, and a discount of 5% for orders of 90 units
or more. What is the cost-minimising order size?

Solution
(a)

The EOQ ignoring discounts is:

125

15% of 200

50 units

Purchases (no discount) 125 $200
Holding costs (50/2) 25 units 15% × $200

With a discount of 3% and an order quantity of 60 units costs are as follows.

Question

Bulk orders

Question: Bulk orders
A company uses an item of inventory as follows.
Purchase price:
Annual demand:
Ordering cost:
Annual holding cost:
Economic order quantity:

$96 per unit
4,000 units
$300
10% of purchase price
500 units

Should the company order 1,000 units at a time in order to secure an 8% discount?

Answer
The total annual cost at the economic order quantity of 500 units is as follows.
Purchases 4,000 $96
Ordering costs $300 (4,000/500)
Holding costs $96 10% (500/2)
The total annual cost at an order quantity of 1,000 units would be as follows.
Purchases $384,000 92%
Ordering costs $300 (4,000/1,000)
Holding costs $96 92% 10% (1,000/2)

2,400
2,400
388,800
$
353,280

The company should order the item 1,000 units at a time, saving $(388,800 – 358,896) = $29,904 a year.

1.9 Just-in-time (JIT)

12/16

Some manufacturing companies have sought to reduce their inventories of raw materials and components
to as low a level as possible. Just-in-time procurement is a term which describes a policy of obtaining
goods from suppliers at the latest possible time (ie when they are needed) and so avoiding the need to
carry any materials or components inventory.
Just-in-time production describes manufacturing to order. As orders are received, manufacturing is
triggered to fulfil those orders. This enables better product customisation, less/no risk of obsolescence
and few holding costs. It does, however, imply a flexible manufacturing process (in terms of what and
how much is made) with follow-on considerations for employment terms. In addition, idle time may need
to be tolerated (although managed to a practical minimum).

Part C Working capital management
w

5: Managing working capital

99

Introducing JIT might bring the following potential benefits.





Reduction in inventory holding costs
Reduced manufacturing lead times
Improved labour productivity
Reduced scrap/rework/warranty costs

Reduced inventory levels mean that a lower level of investment in working capital will be required.
JIT will not be appropriate in some cases. For example, a restaurant might find it preferable to use the
traditional economic order quantity approach for staple non-perishable food inventories but adopt JIT for
perishable and 'exotic' items. In a hospital, a stock-out could quite literally be fatal and so JIT would be
quite unsuitable.

Exam focus
point

You may be required to evaluate the benefits of introducing a JIT arrangement, given certain assumptions
about the costs and benefits.

Case Study
Japanese car manufacturer Toyota was the first company to develop JIT (JIT was originally called the
Toyota Production System). After the end of the world war in 1945, Toyota recognised that it had much to
do to catch up with the US automobile manufacturing industry. The company was making losses. In
Japan, however, consumer demand for cars was weak, and consumers were very resistant to price
increases. Japan also had a bad record for industrial disputes. Toyota itself suffered from major strike
action in 1950.
The individual credited with devising JIT in Toyota from the 1940s was Taiichi Ohno, and JIT techniques
were developed gradually over time.
Ohno identified seven wastes and worked to eliminate them from operations in Toyota. Measures that
were taken by the company included the following.

100

(a)

The aim of reducing costs was of paramount importance in the late 1940s. Toyota was losing
money, and market demand was weak, preventing price rises. The only way to move from losses
into profits was to cut costs, and cost reduction was probably essential for the survival of the
company.

(b)

The company aimed to level the flow of production and eliminate unevenness in the work flow.
Production levelling should help to minimise idle time while at the same time allowing the company
to achieve its objective of minimum inventories.

(c)

The factory layout was changed. Previously all machines, such as presses, were located in the
same area of the factory. Under the new system, different types of machines were clustered
together in production cells.

(d)

Machine operators were retrained.

(e)

Employee involvement in the changes was seen as being particularly important. Teamwork was
promoted.

(f)

The kanban system was eventually introduced, but a major problem with its introduction was the
elimination of defects in production. The kanban system is a 'pull' system of production
scheduling. Items are only produced when they are needed. If a part is faulty when it is produced,
the production line will be held up until the fault is corrected.

2 Managing accounts receivable

9/16, Mar/Jun 17

2.1 Total credit
FAST FORWARD

Giving credit has a cost: the value of the interest charged on an overdraft to fund the period of credit, or
the interest lost on the cash not received and deposited in the bank. An increase in profit from extra sales
resulting from offering credit could offset this cost.
Credit is offered to customers to win sales and sales mean profits. But there is a cost to giving credit. The
benefits should exceed the costs.

2.2 Effect on profit of extending credit
One of the main costs of offering credit is the interest expense. How can we assess the effect on profit?
Let us assume that the Zygo Company sells widgets for $1,000, which enables it to earn a profit, after all
other expenses except interest, of $100 (ie a 10% margin).
(a)

Aibee buys a widget for $1,000 on 1 January 20X1, but does not pay until 31 December 20X1.
Zygo relies on overdraft finance, which costs it 10% p.a. The effect is:
$
Net profit on sale of widget
100
(100)
Overdraft cost $1,000 10% p.a.
Actual profit after 12 months' credit
Nil
In other words, the entire profit margin has been wiped out in 12 months.

(b)

If Aibee had paid after six months, the effect would be:
Net profit
Overdraft cost $1,000

10% p.a.

6/12 months

$
100
(50)
50

Half the profit has been wiped out.
(c)

If the cost of borrowing had been 18%, then the profit would have been absorbed before seven
months had elapsed. If the net profit were 5% and borrowing costs were 15%, the interest expense
would exceed the net profit after four months.

Question

Cost of receivables

Winterson Tools has an average level of accounts receivable of $2m at any time representing 60 days
outstanding. (Their credit terms are 30 days.) The firm borrows money at 10% a year. The managing
director is proud of the credit control: 'I only had to write off $10,000 in bad debts last year,' they said
proudly. Are they right to be proud?

Answer
The managing director may be proud of the low level of bad debts but customers are taking an extra
month to pay and this has a cost. At any one time, there is $1m more money outstanding than there
should be (30/60 days $2m) and this costs $100,000 in interest charges (10% $1m).

Part C Working capital management
w

5: Managing working capital

101

The level of total credit can then have a significant effect on profitability. That said, if credit considerations
are included in pricing calculations, extending credit can, in fact, increase profitability. If offering credit
generates extra sales, then those extra sales will have additional repercussions on:
(a)

The amount of inventory maintained in the warehouse, to ensure that the extra demand must be
satisfied

(b)

The amount of money the company owes to its accounts payable (as it will be increasing its supply
of raw materials)

2.3 Credit control policy

9/16

Several factors should be considered by management when a policy for credit control is formulated.
These include:
(a)

The administrative costs of debt collection

(b)

The procedures for controlling credit to individual customers and for debt collection

(c)

The amount of extra capital required to finance an extension of total credit – there might be an
increase in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable, and the net increase in working
capital must be financed

(d)

The cost of the additional finance required for any increase in the volume of accounts receivable
(or the savings from a reduction in accounts receivable) – this cost might be bank overdraft
interest, or the cost of long-term funds (such as loan inventory or equity)

(e)

Any savings or additional expenses in operating the credit policy (for example the extra work
involved in pursuing slow payers)

(f)

The ways in which the credit policy could be implemented – for example:

(g)

(i)

Credit could be eased by giving accounts receivable a longer period in which to settle their
accounts – the cost would be the resulting increase in accounts receivable.

(ii)

A discount could be offered for early payment – the cost would be the amount of the
discounts taken.

The effects of easing credit, which might be to encourage a higher proportion of bad debts, and an
increase in sales volume. Provided that the extra gross contribution from the increase in sales
exceeds the increase in fixed cost expenses, bad debts, discounts and the finance cost of an
increase in working capital, a policy to relax credit terms would be profitable.

2.4 Assessing creditworthiness
FAST FORWARD

6/15

In managing accounts receivable, the creditworthiness of customers needs to be assessed. The risks and
costs of a customer defaulting will need to be balanced against the profitability of the business provided
by that customer.
Credit control involves the initial investigation of potential credit customers and the continuing control of
outstanding accounts. The main points to note are as follows.

102

(a)

New customers should give two good references, including one from a bank, before being granted
credit.

(b)

Credit ratings might be checked through a credit rating/reference agency.

(c)

A new customer's credit limit should be fixed at a low level and only increased if their payment
record subsequently warrants it.

(d)

For large value customers, a file should be maintained of any available financial information about
the customer. This file should be reviewed regularly. Information is available from the company's
annual report and accounts.

5: Managing working capital

Part C Workingw
capital management


(e)

Government departments can sometimes advise on overseas companies.

(f)

Press comments may give information about what a company is currently doing (as opposed to
the historical results in Extel cards or published accounts which only show what the company has
done in the past).

(g)

The company could send a member of staff to visit the company concerned, to get a first-hand
impression of the company and its prospects. This would be advisable in the case of a prospective
major customer.

An organisation might devise a credit-rating system for new individual customers that is based on
characteristics of the customer (such as whether the customer is a homeowner, and the customer's age
and occupation). Points or ratings would be awarded according to the characteristics of the customer, and
the amount of credit that is offered would depend on their credit score.

2.5 Managing accounts receivable
FAST FORWARD

Regular monitoring of accounts receivable is very important. Individual accounts receivable can be
assessed using a customer history analysis and a credit rating system. The overall level of accounts
receivable can be monitored using an aged accounts receivable listing and credit utilisation report, as
well as reports on the level of bad debts.
(a)

Accounts receivable payment records must be monitored continually. This depends on successful
sales ledger administration.

(b)

Credit monitoring can be simplified by a system of in-house credit ratings. For example, a
company could have five credit-risk categories for its customers. As mentioned above, these credit
categories or ratings could be used to decide either individual credit limits for customers within
that category or the frequency of the credit review.

(c)

A customer's payment record and the accounts receivable aged analysis should be examined
regularly, as a matter of course. Breaches of the credit limit, or attempted breaches of it, should be
brought immediately to the attention of the credit controller.

2.5.1 Policing total credit
The total amount of credit offered, as well as individual accounts, should be policed to ensure that the
senior management policy with regard to the total credit limits is maintained. A credit utilisation report
can indicate the extent to which total limits are being utilised. An example is given below.
Customer

This might contain other information, such as days sales outstanding.
Reviewed in aggregate, this can reveal the following.
(a)

The number of customers who might want more credit

(b)

The extent to which the company is exposed to accounts receivable

(c)

The 'tightness' of the policy (It might be possible to increase profitable sales by offering credit. On
the other hand, perhaps the firm offers credit too easily.)

Part C Working capital management
w

5: Managing working capital

103

It is possible to design credit utilisation reports to highlight other trends.
(a)

The degree of exposure to different countries

(b)

The degree of exposure to different industries (some countries or industries may be worthy of
more credit; others may be too risky)

Credit utilisation can also be analysed by industry within country or by country within industry. It is also
useful to relate credit utilisation to total sales.

2.5.2 Extension of credit
To determine whether it would be profitable to extend the level of total credit, it is necessary to assess:





The extra sales that a more generous credit policy would stimulate
The profitability of the extra sales
The extra length of the average debt collection period
The required rate of return on the investment in additional accounts receivable

2.5.3 Example: A change in credit policy
Russian Beard Co is considering a change of credit policy which will result in an increase in the average
collection period from one to two months. The relaxation in credit is expected to produce an increase in
sales in each year amounting to 25% of the current sales volume.
Selling price per unit
Variable cost per unit
Current annual sales

$10
$8.50
$2,400,000

The required rate of return on investments is 20%. Assume that the 25% increase in sales would result in
additional inventories of $100,000 and additional accounts payable of $20,000.
Advise the company on whether or not to extend the credit period offered to customers, if:
(a)

All customers take the longer credit of two months

(b)

Existing customers do not change their payment habits, and only new customers take a full two
months' credit

Solution
The change in credit policy is justifiable if the rate of return on the additional investment in working capital
would exceed 20%.
Extra profit
Contribution/sales ratio
Increase in sales revenue
Increase in contribution and profit
(a)

Extra investment, if all accounts receivable take two months' credit

Average accounts receivable after the sales increase (2/12 $3,000,000)
Less current average accounts receivable (1/12 $2,400,000)
Increase in accounts receivable
Increase in inventories

Enticement Co currently expects sales of $50,000 a month. Variable costs of sales are $40,000 a month
(all payable in the month of sale). It is estimated that if the credit period allowed to accounts receivable

2.6 Collecting amounts owing
FAST FORWARD

The benefits of action to collect debts must be greater than the costs incurred.
The overall debt collection policy of the firm should be such that the administrative costs and other costs
incurred in debt collection do not exceed the benefits from incurring those costs. Beyond a certain level of
spending, however, additional expenditure on debt collection would not have enough of an effect on bad
debts or on the average collection period to justify the extra administrative costs.
Collecting debts is a two-stage process.
(a)

Having agreed credit terms with a customer, a business should issue an invoice and expect to
receive payment when it is due. Issuing invoices and receiving payments is the task of sales
ledger staff. They should ensure that:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

The customer is fully aware of the terms.
The invoice is correctly drawn up and issued promptly.
They are aware of any potential quirks in the customer's system.
Queries are resolved quickly.
Monthly statements are issued promptly.

Part C Working capital management
w

5: Managing working capital

105

(b)

If payments become overdue, priority ones should be 'chased'. Procedures for pursuing overdue
debts must be established, for example:
(i)

Instituting reminders or final demands
These should be sent to a named individual, asking for repayment by return of post. A
second or third letter may be required, followed by a final demand stating clearly the action
that will be taken. The aim is to goad customers into action, perhaps by threatening not to
sell any more goods on credit until the debt is cleared.

(ii)

Chasing payment by telephone
The telephone is of greater nuisance value than a letter, and the greater immediacy can
encourage a response. It can be time consuming, however, particularly because of
problems in getting through to the right person.

(iii)

Making a personal approach
Personal visits can be very time consuming and tend only to be made to important
customers who are worth the effort.

2.7 Early settlement discounts
FAST FORWARD

9/15

Early settlement discounts may be employed to shorten average credit periods and to reduce the
investment in accounts receivable and therefore interest costs of the finance invested in trade receivables.
The benefit in interest cost saved should exceed the cost of the discounts allowed.

To see whether the offer of a settlement discount (for early payment) is financially worthwhile we must
compare the cost of the discount with the benefit of a reduced investment in accounts receivable.
Varying the discount allowed for early payment of debts affects the average collection period and affects
the volume of demand (and possibly, therefore, indirectly affects bad debt losses). We shall begin with
examples where the offer of a discount for early payment does not affect the volume of demand.

2.8 Example: Settlement discount
Lowe and Price Co has annual credit sales of $12,000,000, and three months are allowed for payment. The
company decides to offer a 2% discount for payments made within 10 days of the invoice being sent, and
to reduce the maximum time allowed for payment to two months. It is estimated that 50% of customers
will take the discount.
If the company requires a 20% return on investments, what will be the effect of the discount?
Assume that the volume of sales will be unaffected by the discount.

Solution
Our approach is to calculate:
(a)
(b)

106

The profits forgone by offering the discount
The interest charges saved or incurred as a result of the changes in the cash flows of the company

Thus:
(a)

The volume of accounts receivable, if the company policy remains unchanged, would be:
3/12

(b)

$12,000,000 = $3,000,000.

If the policy is changed the volume of accounts receivable would be:
50%

(10/365

$12,000,000) + (2/12

50%

$12,000,000) = $164,384 + $1,000,000

= $1,164,384.
(c)

There will be a reduction in accounts receivable of $1,835,616.

(d)

Since the company can invest at 20% a year, the value of a reduction in accounts receivable (a source
of funds) is 20% of $1,835,616 each year in perpetuity, that is, $367,123 a year.

(e)

Summary

An extension of the payment period allowed to accounts receivable may be introduced in order to increase sales
volume.

Note that the effect of the settlement discount was not included in step (b) of the previous example. This is
correct if sales are recorded before the effect of the settlement discount (this is normally recorded
separately). This is the approach that has been adopted in past ACCA Financial Management exam
questions.

2.10 Bad debt risk
Different credit policies are likely to have differing levels of bad debt risk. The higher revenue resulting
from easier credit terms should be sufficiently profitable to exceed the cost of:




Additional bad debts, and
The additional investment necessary to achieve the higher sales.

2.10.1 Example: Receivables management
Grabbit Quick Co achieves current annual sales of $1,800,000. The cost of sales is 80% of this amount,
but bad debts average 1% of total sales, and the annual profit is as follows.

The current debt collection period is one month, and the management consider that, if credit terms were
eased (Option A), the effects would be as follows.
Present policy

The company requires a 20% return on its investments. The costs of sales are 75% variable and 25%
fixed. Assume there would be no increase in fixed costs from the extra revenue and that there would be no
increase in average inventories or accounts payable. Which is the preferable policy, Option A or the
present one?

Solution
The increase in profit before the cost of additional finance for Option A can be found as follows.
(a)

$
Increase in contribution from additional sales
25% $1,800,000 40%*
Less increase in bad debts (3% $2,250,000) – $18,000

80%) = 40%

Additional investment required

$
375,000
150,000
225,000

Cost of additional finance at 20%

$45,000

As the increase in profit exceeds the cost of additional finance, Option A should be adopted.

2.10.2 Credit insurance
Companies may be able to obtain credit insurance against certain approved debts going bad through a
specialist credit insurance firm. A company cannot insure against all its bad debt losses, but may be able
to insure against losses above a 'normal' level.
When a company arranges credit insurance, it must submit specific proposals for credit to the insurance
company, stating the name of each customer to which it wants to give credit and the amount of credit it
wants to give. The insurance company will accept, amend or refuse these proposals, depending on its
assessment of each of these customers.

2.11 Factoring
FAST FORWARD

Exam focus
point

6/15

Some companies use either factoring or invoice discounting to improve liquidity or to reduce
administration costs. Insurance, particularly of overseas debts, can also help reduce the risk of bad debts.

You may find it useful to read the article titled 'Receivables collection' (and a follow on article written by
the same author titled 'Accounts receivable management') on the ACCA website. This covers factoring and
early settlement discounts. In addition there is a short article on some of the extra complications in the
management of foreign accounts receivable.
A factor is defined as 'a doer or transactor of business for another', but a factoring organisation
specialises in trade debts, and manages the debts owed to a client (a business customer) on the client's
behalf.

Key term

Factoring is an arrangement to have debts collected by a factor company, which advances a proportion of
the money it is due to collect.

2.11.1 Aspects of factoring
The main aspects of factoring include the following.

(a)

Administration of the client's invoicing, sales accounting and debt collection service

(b)

Credit protection for the client's debts, whereby the factor takes over the risk of loss from bad
debts and so 'insures' the client against such losses. This is known as a non-recourse service.
However, if a non-recourse service is provided, the factor, not the firm, will decide what action to
take against non-payers.

(c)

Making payments to the client in advance of collecting the debts. This is sometimes referred to as
'factor finance' because the factor is providing cash to the client against outstanding debts.)

2.11.2 Benefits of factoring
The benefits of factoring for a business customer include the following.
(a)

The business receives early payment for most of its receivables in the form of finance from the
factor. It can use this money to pay its suppliers.

(b)

Optimum inventory levels can be maintained, because the business will have enough cash to pay
for the inventories it needs.

(c)

Growth can be financed through sales rather than by injecting fresh external capital.

(d)

The business gets finance linked to its volume of sales. In contrast, overdraft limits tend to be
determined by historical statements of financial position.

(e)

The managers of the business do not have to spend their time on the problems of slow-paying
accounts receivable. Factoring organisations are also likely to employ staff who are experienced
and skilled at collecting payments from customers and chasing overdue payments.

(f)

The business does not incur the costs of running its own sales ledger department, and can use
the expertise of debtor management that the factor has.

An important disadvantage is that credit customers will be making payments direct to the factor, which is
likely to present a negative picture of the firm's attitude to customer relations. It may also indicate that
the firm is in need of rapid cash, raising questions about its financial stability.

2.11.3 Example: Factoring
A company makes annual credit sales of $1,500,000. Credit terms are 30 days, but its debt administration
has been poor and the average collection period has been 45 days with 0.5% of sales resulting in bad
debts which are written off.
A factor would take on the task of debt administration and credit checking, at an annual fee of 2.5% of
credit sales. The company would save $30,000 a year in administration costs. The payment period would
be 30 days.
The factor would also provide an advance of 80% of invoiced debts at an interest rate of 14% (3% over
the current base rate). The company can obtain an overdraft facility to finance its accounts receivable at a
rate of 2.5% over base rate.
Should the factor's services be accepted? Assume a constant monthly revenue.

Solution
It is assumed that the factor would advance an amount equal to 80% of the invoiced debts, and the
balance 30 days later.
(a)

The current situation is as follows, using the company's debt collection staff and a bank overdraft
to finance all debts.
Credit sales
Average credit period
The annual cost is as follows.
45/365 $1,500,000 13.5% (11% + 2.5%)
Bad debts 0.5% $1,500,000

Total cost

$
24,966
7,500

62,466

(b)

The cost of the factor. 80% of credit sales financed by the factor would be 80% of $1,500,000 =
$1,200,000. For a consistent comparison, we must assume that 20% of credit sales would be
financed by a bank overdraft. The average credit period would be only 30 days. The annual cost
would be as follows.
$
13,808
Factor's finance 30/365 $1,200,000 14%
3,329
Overdraft 30/365 $300,000 13.5%
17,137
37,500
Cost of factor's services: 2.5% $1,500,000
Cost of the factor
54,637

(c)

Conclusion. The factor is cheaper. In this case, the factor's fees exactly equal the savings in bad
debts ($7,500) and administration costs ($30,000). The factor is then cheaper overall because it
will be more efficient at collecting debts. The advance of 80% of debts is not needed, however, if
the company has sufficient overdraft facility because the factor's finance charge of 14% is higher
than the company's overdraft rate of 13.5%.

An alternative way of carrying out the calculation is to consider the changes in costs that using a factor
will mean.

Points to look out for in questions about factoring are who bears the risk of bad debts, and company
administration costs that may be saved by using a factor. The ACCA examining team has commented that
calculations of the cost of factoring have often been poor.

2.12 Invoice discounting
Key term

Invoice discounting is the purchase (by the provider of the discounting service) of trade debts at a
discount. Invoice discounting enables the company from which the debts are purchased to raise working
capital.
Invoice discounting is related to factoring and many factors will provide an invoice discounting service. It
is the purchase of a selection of invoices, at a discount. The invoice discounter does not take over the
administration of the client's sales ledger.

A client should only want to have some invoices discounted when they have a temporary cash shortage,
and so invoice discounting tends to consist of one-off deals. Confidential invoice discounting is an
arrangement whereby a debt is confidentially assigned to the factor, and the client's customer will only
become aware of the arrangement if they do not pay their debt to the client.
If a client needs to generate cash, they can approach a factor or invoice discounter, who will offer to
purchase selected invoices and advance up to 75% of their value. At the end of each month, the factor will
pay over the balance of the purchase price, less charges, on the invoices that have been settled in the
month.

Exam focus
point

Don't confuse invoice discounting with early settlement discounts. They are not the same thing.

2.13 Managing foreign accounts receivable
FAST FORWARD

9/15

Exporters have to address the problems of larger inventories and accounts receivable, and an increased
risk of bad debts due to the transportation time and additional paperwork involved in sending goods
abroad.
Foreign debts raise the following special problems.

(a)

When goods are sold abroad, the customer might ask for credit. Exports take time to arrange, and
there might be complex paperwork. Transporting the goods can be slow, if they are sent by sea.
These delays in foreign trade mean that exporters often build up large investments in inventories
and accounts receivable. These working capital investments have to be financed somehow.

(b)

The risk of bad debts can be greater with foreign trade than with domestic trade. If a foreign
debtor refuses to pay a debt, the exporter must pursue the debt in the debtor's own country, where
procedures will be subject to the laws of that country.

Some businesses may decide to trust the foreign receivable and not take any special measures to reduce
the non-payment risk. This method is known as open account.
However, there are several measures available to exporters to help overcome risks of non-payment.

2.13.1 Reducing the investment in foreign accounts receivable
A company can reduce its investment in foreign accounts receivable by insisting on earlier payment for
goods. Another approach is for an exporter to arrange for a bank to give cash for a foreign debt sooner
than the exporter would receive payment in the normal course of events. There are several ways in which
this might be done.

Part C Working capital management
w

5: Managing working capital

111

(a)

Advances against collections. Where the exporter asks their bank to handle the collection of
payment (of a bill of exchange or a cheque) on their behalf, the bank may be prepared to make an
advance to the exporter against the collection. The amount of the advance might be 80% to 90% of
the value of the collection.

(b)

Negotiation of bills or cheques. This is similar to an advance against collection, but would be used
where the bill or cheque is payable outside the exporter's country (for example in the foreign
buyer's country).

(c)

Discounting bills of exchange. This is where the customer agrees to accept a bill of exchange
drawn on the customer by the exporter. The exporter's bank may buy the bill before it is due for
payment (at a discount to face value) and credit the proceeds from this sale to the company's
account.

(d)

Documentary credits. These are described below.

(e)

Forfaiting. This is also described below.

2.13.2 Reducing the bad debt risk
Methods of minimising bad debt risks are broadly similar to those for domestic trade. An exporting
company should vet the creditworthiness of each customer, and grant credit terms accordingly.

2.13.3 Export factoring
The functions performed by an overseas factor or export factor are essentially the same as with the
factoring of domestic trade debts, which was described earlier in this chapter.
Factoring can be more expensive than credit insurance (explained below) and may not be available in all
countries.

2.13.4 Documentary credits
Documentary credits ('letters of credit') provide a method of payment in international trade, which gives
the exporter a secure risk-free method of obtaining payment.
The process works as follows:

(a)

The buyer (a foreign buyer or domestic importer) and the seller (a domestic exporter or foreign
supplier) first of all agree a contract for the sale of the goods, which provides for payment through
a documentary credit.

(b)

The buyer then requests a bank in their country to issue a letter of credit in favour of the exporter.
The bank which issues the letter of credit is known as the issuing bank.

(c)

The issuing bank, by issuing its letter of credit, guarantees payment to the exporter on condition
that the exporter complies with certain specified conditions in the letter of credit (relating to such
matters as presenting documentation for the export shipment and shipping the goods before a
latest shipment date).

(d)

The goods are despatched and the shipping documentation is sent to the purchaser's bank.

(e)

The bank issues a banker's acceptance.

(f)

The seller either keeps the banker's acceptance until maturity or sells it at a discount on the money
market.

A documentary credit arrangement must be made between the exporter, the buyer and participating banks
before the export sale takes place. Documentary credits are slow to arrange, administratively
cumbersome and inflexible. For example, the exact conditions of the letter of credit must be met. If the
letter of credit states that shipping documents are required, then the seller would be unable to claim
payment if the goods were sent by air. Despite these drawbacks, letters of credit might be considered
essential where the risk of non-payment is high.

Part C Workingw
capital management


2.13.5 Forfaiting
Key term

Forfaiting is a method of export finance whereby a bank purchases from a company a number of sales
invoices, usually obtaining a guarantee of payment of the invoices.
Forfaiting is the most common method of providing medium-term (say, three to five years) export
finance. It has normally been used for export sales involving capital goods (such as machinery), where
payments will be made over a number of years. It is usually available for large amounts (over $250,000),
but only in the major convertible currencies.

The forfaiter buys the foreign accounts receivable from a seller at a discount and takes on all of the credit
risk from the transaction (without recourse). The receivables then become a form of debt instrument
which can be sold on the money market.
Forfaiting can be an expensive choice, and arranging it takes time. However, it can be a useful way of
enabling trade to occur in cases where other methods of ensuring payment and smooth cash flow are not
certain, and in cases where trade may not be possible by other means.

2.13.6 Countertrade
Countertrade is a means of financing trade in which goods are exchanged for other goods. Three parties
might be involved in a 'triangular' deal. Countertrade is thus a form of barter and can involve complex
negotiations and logistics. One of the main problems with countertrade is that the value of the goods
received in exchange may be uncertain.

2.13.7 Export credit insurance
Key term

Export credit insurance is insurance against the risk of non-payment by foreign customers for export
debts.

You might be wondering why export credit insurance should be necessary, when exporters can pursue
non-paying customers through the courts in order to obtain payment. The answer is that:
(a)

If a credit customer defaults on payment, the task of pursuing the case through the courts will be
lengthy, and it might be a long time before payment is eventually obtained.

(b)

There are various reasons why non-payment might happen. For example, the seller can be insured
against slow payment, insolvency, certain political risks and changes in import or export
regulations.

Not all exporters take out export credit insurance because premiums are very high and the benefits are
sometimes not fully appreciated. If they do, they will obtain an insurance policy from a private insurance
company that deals in export credit insurance. Note that insurance does not usually cover 100% of the
value of the foreign sales.

2.13.8 General policies for overseas accounts receivable
There are also a number of general credit control policies that can be particularly important when dealing
with overseas customers.
(a)

Prior to the sale, the customer's credit rating should be checked, and the terms of the contract
specified. One key term may be demanding the use of a letter of credit as a condition for the
transaction. The terms of the remittance and the bank to be used should be specified.

(b)

The paperwork relating to the sales should be carefully completed and checked, in particular the
shipping and delivery documentation.

(c)

Goods should only be released to the custody of the buyer if payment has been made, or is
sufficiently certain, either because of the customer's previous record or because the customer has
arranged for its bank to accept a bill of exchange on behalf of the buyer.

(d)

Receipts should be rapidly processed and late payments chased.

3 Managing accounts payable
Performance objective 10 requires you to 'prepare and monitor an organisation's cash flow, credit
facilities and advise on appropriate actions'. This section covers the management of accounts payable and
credit terms.
FAST FORWARD

Exam focus
point

Effective management of trade accounts payable involves seeking satisfactory credit terms from supplier,
getting credit extended during periods of cash shortage and maintaining good relations with suppliers.
It may seem an obvious point, but take care not to confuse accounts receivable and accounts payable, as
many students do under exam pressure.

3.1 Management of trade accounts payable
The management of trade accounts payable involves:


Attempting to obtain satisfactory credit from suppliers



Attempting to extend credit during periods of cash shortage, without damaging a good business
relationship with the supplier



Maintaining good relations with regular and important suppliers

If a supplier offers a discount for the early payment of debts, the evaluation of the decision whether or not
to accept the discount is similar to the evaluation of the decision whether or not to offer a discount. One
problem is the mirror image of the other. The methods of evaluating the offer of a discount to customers
were described earlier.

3.1.1 Trade credit

9/16

Taking credit from suppliers is a normal feature of business. Nearly every company has some trade
accounts payable waiting for payment. It is particularly important to small and fast-growing firms. Trade
credit is a source of short-term finance because it helps to keep working capital down. It is usually a cheap
source of finance, since suppliers rarely charge interest. The costs of making maximum use of trade credit
include the loss of suppliers' goodwill, and the loss of any available cash discounts for the early payment
of debts.

3.1.2 The cost of lost early payment discounts
The cost of lost cash discounts can be calculated by comparing the saving from the discount with the
opportunity cost of investing the cash used.
The cost of lost cash discounts can also be estimated by the formula:
100
(100 – d)

365
t

–1 %

Where d is the % discount, d = 5 for 5%
t is the reduction in the payment period in days which would be necessary to obtain the early
payment discount, final date to obtain discount – final date for payment.
This is the same formula that was used for accounts receivable.

114

5: Managing working capital

Part C Workingw
capital management



3.2 Example: Trade credit
X Co has been offered credit terms from its major supplier of 2/10, net 45. That is, a cash discount of 2%
will be given if payment is made within ten days of the invoice, and payments must be made within 45
days of the invoice. The company has the choice of paying 98c per $1 on day 10 (to pay before day 10
would be unnecessary), or to invest the 98c for an additional 35 days and eventually pay the supplier $1
per $1. The decision as to whether the discount should be accepted depends on the opportunity cost of
investing 98c for 35 days. What should the company do?

Solution
Suppose that X Co can invest cash to obtain an annual return of 25%, and that there is an invoice from the
supplier for $1,000. The two alternatives are as follows.
Refuse
Accept
discount
discount
$
$
Payment to supplier
1,000.0
980
Return from investing $980 between day 10 and day 45:
23.5
$980 35/365 25%
980
976.5
Net cost
It is cheaper to refuse the discount because the investment rate of return on cash retained, in this
example, exceeds the saving from the discount.
Although a company may delay payment beyond the final due date, thereby obtaining even longer credit
from its suppliers, such a policy would generally be inadvisable. Unacceptable delays in payment will
worsen the company's credit rating, and additional credit may become difficult to obtain.

3.3 Managing foreign accounts payable
Foreign accounts payable will be subject to exchange rate risk. Companies expecting to pay foreign
currency in the future will be concerned about the possibility of domestic currency depreciating against
the foreign currency, making the cost of the supplies more expensive.
Companies sometimes pay into an overseas bank account today and then let the cash earn some interest
so they can pay off the invoice in the future. This method of avoiding exchange rate risk is called leading.
The management of exchange rate risk is covered in Chapter 19.



An economic order quantity can be calculated as a guide to minimising costs in managing inventory
levels. However, bulk discounts can mean that a different order quantity minimises inventory costs.



Uncertainties in demand and lead times taken to fulfil orders mean that inventory will be ordered once it
reaches a re-order level (maximum usage × maximum lead time).



Giving credit has a cost: the value of the interest charged on an overdraft to fund the period of credit, or
the interest lost on the cash not received and deposited in the bank. An increase in profit from extra sales
resulting from offering credit could offset this cost.



In managing accounts receivable, the creditworthiness of customers needs to be assessed. The risks and
costs of a customer defaulting will need to be balanced against the profitability of the business provided
by that customer.



Regular monitoring of accounts receivable is very important. Individual accounts receivable can be
assessed using a customer history analysis and a credit rating system. The overall level of accounts
receivable can be monitored using an aged accounts receivable listing and credit utilisation report, as
well as reports on the level of bad debts.



The benefits of action to collect debts must be greater than the costs incurred.



Early settlement discounts may be employed to shorten average credit periods and to reduce the
investment in accounts receivable and therefore interest costs of the finance invested in trade receivables.
The benefit in interest cost saved should exceed the cost of the discounts allowed.



Some companies use either factoring or invoice discounting to improve liquidity or to reduce
administration costs. Insurance, particularly of overseas debts, can also help reduce the risk of bad debts.

Exporters have to address the problems of larger inventories and accounts receivable, and an increased
risk of bad debts due to the transportation time and additional paperwork involved in sending goods
abroad.

Effective management of trade accounts payable involves seeking satisfactory credit terms from supplier,
getting credit extended during periods of cash shortage and maintaining good relations with suppliers.

Introduction
This chapter concludes our study of working capital management methods by
considering how cash is managed. This involves looking at the various reasons
for holding cash, the preparation of cash flow forecasts and relevant
techniques for managing cash. We revisit how working capital needs are

Exam guide
The material covered in this chapter is again highly examinable. Any of the calculations could form part or
all of a question and you also need to be able to explain the meaning of your answers.
Performance objective 10 requires you to 'prepare and monitor an organisation's cash flow, credit
facilities and advise on appropriate actions'. This chapter covers the management of cash and cash flow
forecasts.

1 The management of cash
1.1 Why organisations hold cash
There are three main reasons for holding cash.

120

(a)

Firstly, a business needs cash to meet its regular commitments of paying its accounts payable, its
employees' wages, its taxes, its annual dividends to shareholders, and so on. This reason for
holding cash sometimes referred to as the transactions motive.

(b)

There may also be a precautionary motive for holding cash. This means that there is a need to
maintain a 'buffer' of cash for unforeseen contingencies. In the context of a business, this buffer

6: Working capital finance

Part C Workingg capital
management
w


may be provided by an overdraft facility, which has the advantage that it will cost nothing until it is
actually used.
(c)

A third motive for holding cash is the speculative motive. Some businesses hold surplus cash as a
speculative asset in the hope that interest rates will rise. However, many businesses would regard
large long-term holdings of cash as not prudent.

How much cash should a company keep on hand or 'on short call' at a bank? The more cash on hand, the
easier it will be for the company to meet its bills as they fall due and to take advantage of discounts.
However, holding cash or near equivalents to cash has a cost – the loss of earnings which would
otherwise have been obtained by using the funds in another way. The financial manager must try to
balance liquidity with profitability.

1.2 Cash flow problems
Cash flow problems can arise in various ways.
(a)

Making losses
If a business is continually making losses, it will eventually have cash flow problems. If the loss is
due to a large depreciation charge, the cash flow troubles might only begin when the business
needs to replace non-current assets.

(b)

Inflation
In a period of inflation, a business needs ever-increasing amounts of cash just to replace used-up
and worn-out assets. A business can be making a profit in historical cost accounting terms, but
still not be receiving enough cash to buy the replacement assets it needs.

(c)

Growth
When a business is growing, it needs to acquire more non-current assets, and to support higher
amounts of inventories and accounts receivable. These additional assets must be paid for
somehow (or financed by accounts payable).

(d)

Seasonal business
When a business has seasonal or cyclical sales, it may have cash flow difficulties at certain times
of the year, when:

(e)

(i)

Cash inflows are low, but

(ii)

Cash outflows are high, perhaps because the business is building up its inventories for the
next period of high sales.

One-off items of expenditure
A single non-recurring item of expenditure may create a cash flow problem. Examples include the
repayment of loan capital on maturity of the debt or the purchase of an exceptionally expensive
item, such as a freehold property.

2 Cash flow forecasts
FAST FORWARD

Key term

Cash flow forecasts show the expected receipts and payments during a forecast period and are a vital
management control tool, especially during times of recession.
A cash flow forecast is a detailed forecast of cash inflows and outflows incorporating both revenue and
capital items.
A cash flow forecast is thus a statement in which estimated future cash receipts and payments are
tabulated in such a way as to show the forecast cash balance of a business at defined intervals.

For example, in December 20X2 an accounts department might wish to estimate the cash position of the
business during the three following months, January to March 20X3. A cash flow forecast might be drawn

Closing cash balance

10,500
3,500

In the example above (where the figures are purely for illustration) the accounts department has calculated
that the cash balance at the beginning of the flow forecast period, 1 January, will be $1,200. Estimates
have been made of the cash which is likely to be received by the business (from cash and credit sales, and
from a planned disposal of non-current assets in February). Similar estimates have been made of cash due
to be paid out by the business (payments to suppliers and employees, payments for rent, rates and other
overheads, payment for a planned purchase of non-current assets in February and a loan repayment due in
January).
From these estimates it is a simple step to calculate the excess of cash receipts over cash payments in
each month. In some months cash payments may exceed cash receipts and there will be a deficit for the
month; this occurs during February in the above example because of the large investment in non-current
assets in that month.
The last part of the cash flow forecast above shows how the business's estimated cash balance can then
be rolled along from month to month. Starting with the opening balance of $1,200 at 1 January a cash
surplus of $2,300 is generated in January. This leads to a closing January balance of $3,500 which
becomes the opening balance for February. The deficit of $5,800 in February throws the business's cash
position into overdraft and the overdrawn balance of $2,300 becomes the opening balance for March.
Finally, the healthy cash surplus of $5,300 in March leaves the business with a favourable cash position of
$3,000 at the end of the flow forecast period.

Exam focus
point

When preparing cash flow forecasts, it is vital that your work is clearly laid out, and referenced to
workings where appropriate.

2.1 The usefulness of cash flow forecasts

12/14

The cash flow forecast is one of the most important planning tools that an organisation can use. It shows
the cash effect of all plans made within the flow forecasting process and its preparation can therefore lead
to a modification of flow forecasts if it shows that there are insufficient cash resources to finance the
planned operations.
It can also give management an indication of potential problems that could arise and allows them the
opportunity to take action to avoid such problems. A cash flow forecast can show four positions.
Management will need to take appropriate action depending on the potential position.

Cash position

Appropriate management action

Short-term surplus

Pay accounts payable early to obtain discount
Attempt to increase sales by increasing accounts receivable and inventories

Short-term deficit

Increase accounts payable by delaying payments to suppliers
Reduce accounts receivable by improving collection of overdue payments
Arrange a bank overdraft facility, or increase the limit on an existing facility

Long-term surplus

Make long-term investments

Consider shutdown/disinvestment opportunities

A cash flow forecast question could ask you to prepare the cash flow forecast and then recommend
appropriate action for management. Ensure your advice takes account both of whether there is a surplus
or deficit and whether the position is long or short term.

2.2 What to include in a cash flow forecast
A cash flow forecast is prepared to show the expected receipts of cash and payments of cash during a
budget period.
It should be obvious that the profit or loss made by an organisation during an accounting period does
not reflect its cash flow position for the following reasons.
(a)

Not all cash receipts affect statement of profit or loss income.

(b)

Not all cash payments affect statement of profit or loss expenditure.

(c)

Some costs in the statement of profit or loss, such as profit or loss on sale of non-current assets
or depreciation, are not cash items but are costs derived from accounting conventions.

(d)

The timing of cash receipts and payments may not coincide with the recording of statement of
profit or loss transactions. For example, a charge for rent or electricity might be made in respect of
20X6 and shown in the statement of profit or loss for that year, but paid in 20X7.

To ensure that there is sufficient cash in hand to cope adequately with planned activities, management
should therefore prepare and pay close attention to a cash flow forecast rather than a statement of profit
or loss.

Exam focus
point

Clear workings and assumptions are very important in a cash flow forecast.

2.3 Example: Cash flow forecast
Peter Blair has worked for some years as a sales representative, but has recently been made redundant.
He intends to start up in business on his own account, using $15,000 which he currently has invested with
a building society. Peter maintains a bank account showing a small credit balance, and he plans to
approach his bank for the necessary additional finance. Peter provides the following additional
information.
(a)

Arrangements have been made to purchase non-current assets costing $8,000. These will be paid
for at the end of September and are expected to have a five-year life, at the end of which they will
possess a nil residual value.

Part C Working capital management
w

6: Working capital finance

123

(b)

Inventories costing $5,000 will be acquired on 28 September and subsequent monthly purchases
will be at a level sufficient to replace forecast sales for the month.

(c)

Forecast monthly sales are $3,000 for October, $6,000 for November and December, and $10,500
from January 20X4 onwards.

(d)

Selling price is fixed at the cost of inventory plus 50%.

(e)

Two months' credit will be allowed to customers but only one month's credit will be received from
suppliers of inventory.

(f)

Running expenses, including rent but excluding depreciation of non-current assets, are estimated
at $1,600 per month.

(g)

Blair intends to make monthly cash drawings of $1,000.

Required
Prepare a cash flow forecast for the six months to 31 March 20X4.

Solution
The opening cash balance at 1 October is $7,000 which consists of Peter's initial $15,000 less the $8,000
expended on non-current assets purchased in September. Cash receipts from credit customers arise two
months after the relevant sales.
Payments to suppliers are a little more tricky. We are told that cost of sales is 100/150 sales. Thus for
October cost of sales is 100/150 $3,000 = $2,000. These goods will be purchased in October but not
paid for until November. Similar calculations can be made for later months. The initial inventory of $5,000
is purchased in September and consequently paid for in October.
Depreciation is not a cash flow and so is not included in a cash flow forecast.

2.4 Cash flow forecasts and an opening statement of financial position
You might be given a cash flow forecast question in which you are required to analyse an opening
statement of financial position to decide how many outstanding accounts receivable will pay what they
owe in the first few months of the cash flow forecast period, and how many outstanding accounts payable
must be paid.
Suppose that a statement of financial position as at 31 December 20X4 shows accounts receivable of
$150,000 and trade accounts payable of $60,000. The following information is also relevant.




Accounts receivable are allowed two months to pay.
11/2 months' credit is taken from trade accounts payable.
Sales and materials purchases were both made at an even monthly rate.

Let's try to ascertain the months of 20X5 in which the accounts receivable will eventually pay and the
accounts payable will be paid.

124

6: Working capital finance

Part C Workingg capital
management
w


(a)

Since accounts receivable take two months to pay, the $150,000 of accounts receivable in the
statement of financial position represents credit sales in November and December 20X4, who will
pay in January and February 20X5 respectively. Since sales in 20X4 were at an equal monthly rate,
the cash flow forecast should plan for receipts of $75,000 each month in January and February
from the accounts receivable in the opening statement of financial position.

(b)

Similarly, since accounts payable are paid after 11/2 months, the statement of financial position
accounts payable will be paid in January and the first half of February 20X5, which means that flow
forecasted payments will be as follows.
$
In January (purchases in second half of Nov and first half of Dec 20X4)
40,000
In February (purchases in second half of Dec 20X4)
20,000
Total accounts payable in the statement of financial position
60,000
Note. The accounts payable of $60,000 represent 11/2 months' purchases, so that purchases in
20X4 must be $40,000 per month, which is $20,000 per half month.

2.5 Example: A month by month cash flow forecast
From the following information which relates to George and Zola Co you are required to prepare a month
by month cash flow forecast for the second half of 20X5 and to append such brief comments as you
consider might be helpful to management.
(a)

The company's only product, a vest, sells at $40 and has a variable cost of $26 made up of
material $20, labour $4 and overhead $2.

Fixed costs of $6,000 per month are paid on the 28 of each month.

(a)

There will be a small overdraft at the end of August but a much larger one at the end of October. It
may be possible to delay payments to suppliers for longer than two months or to reduce purchases
of materials or reduce the volume of production by running down existing inventory levels.

(b)

If neither of these courses is possible, the company may need to negotiate overdraft facilities with
its bank.

(c)

The cash deficit is only temporary and by the end of December there will be a comfortable surplus.
The use to which this cash will be put should ideally be planned in advance.

You may be asked to prepare a cash flow forecast, and also consider the effects on the flow forecast or
particular figures in it of the original assumptions changing.

The overdraft arrangements are quite inadequate to service the cash needs of the business over the
six-month period. If the figures are realistic then action should be taken now to avoid difficulties in
the near future. The following are possible courses of action.
(i)

Activities could be curtailed.

(ii)

Other sources of cash could be explored, for example a long-term loan to finance the
capital expenditure and a factoring arrangement to provide cash due from accounts
receivable more quickly.

(iii)

Efforts to increase the speed of debt collection could be made.

(iv)

Payments to accounts payable could be delayed.

(v)

The dividend payments could be postponed (the figures indicate that this is a small
company, possibly owner managed).

(vi)

Staff might be persuaded to work at a lower rate in return for, say, an annual bonus or a
profit-sharing agreement.

(vii)

Extra staff might be taken on to reduce the amount of overtime paid.

(viii)

The inventory holding policy should be reviewed; it may be possible to meet demand from
current production and minimise cash tied up in inventories.

Performance objective 10 requires you to 'contribute to the operation of systems for managing cash,
short-term liquidity and working capital'. You can apply the knowledge you learn from this chapter to help
demonstrate this competence.

2.6 Methods of easing cash shortages
FAST FORWARD

Cash shortages can be eased by postponing capital expenditure, selling assets, taking longer to pay
accounts payable and pressing accounts receivable for earlier payment.
The steps that are usually taken by a company when a need for cash arises, and when it cannot obtain
resources from any other source, such as a loan or an increased overdraft, are as follows.
(a)

Postponing capital expenditure
Some new non-current assets might be needed for the development and growth of the business,
but some capital expenditures might be postponable without serious consequences. If a company's
policy is to replace company cars every two years, but the company is facing a cash shortage, it
might decide to replace cars every three years.

(b)

Accelerating cash inflows which would otherwise be expected in a later period
One way would be to press accounts receivable for earlier payment. Often, this policy will result in
a loss of goodwill and problems with customers. It might be possible to encourage credit
customers to pay more quickly by offering discounts for earlier payment.

(c)

Reversing past investment decisions by selling assets previously acquired
Some assets are less crucial to a business than others. If cash flow problems are severe, the option
of selling investments or property might have to be considered. Sale and leaseback of property
could also be considered.

(d)

Negotiating a reduction in cash outflows to postpone or reduce payments
There are several ways in which this could be done.
(i)

Longer credit might be taken from suppliers. Such an extension of credit would have to be
negotiated carefully: there would be a risk of having further supplies refused.

(ii)

Loan repayments could be rescheduled by agreement with a bank.

(iii)

A deferral of the payment of company tax might be agreed with the taxation authorities.
However, they will charge interest on the outstanding amount of tax.

(iv)

Dividend payments could be reduced. Dividend payments are discretionary cash outflows,
although a company's directors might be constrained by shareholders' expectations, so that
they feel obliged to pay dividends even when there is a cash shortage.

2.7 Deviations from expected cash flows
Cash flow forecasts, whether prepared on an annual, monthly, weekly or even daily basis, can only be
estimates of cash flows. Even the best estimates will not be exactly correct, so deviations from the cash
flow forecast are inevitable.
A cash flow forecast model could be constructed, using a PC and a spreadsheet package, and the
sensitivity of cash flow forecasts to changes in estimates of sales, costs, and so on could be analysed. By
planning for different eventualities, management should be able to prepare contingency measures in
advance and also appreciate the key factors in the cash flow forecast.
A knowledge of the probability distribution of possible outcomes for the cash position will allow a more
accurate estimate to be made of the minimum cash balances, or the borrowing power necessary, to
provide a satisfactory margin of safety. Unforeseen deficits can be hard to finance at short notice, and
advance planning is desirable.

3 Treasury management
FAST FORWARD

A large organisation will have a treasury department to manage liquidity, short-term investment,
borrowings, foreign exchange risk and other, specialised areas such as forward contracts and futures.
Large companies rely heavily on the financial and currency markets. These markets are volatile, with
interest rates and foreign exchange rates changing continually and by significant amounts. To manage
cash (funds) and risk efficiently, many large companies have set up a separate treasury department.
A treasury department, even in a large organisation, is likely to be quite small, with a staff of perhaps three
to six qualified accountants, bankers or corporate treasurers working under the treasurer.
A treasury department will normally provide four key functions:
(a)

Management of liquidity
This will involve investing short-term cash surpluses, and financing short-term cash deficits (this is
covered in more detail later in this chapter).

(b)

Management of funding
This will involve consideration of long-term capital structure issues (this is covered in more detail
in Chapter 16).

(c)

Management of risk
This is covered in Chapters 19 and 20.

(d)

Advising on corporate finance issues
For example issues involving dividend policy (Chapter 13) and business valuations (Chapter 17).

3.1 Centralisation of the treasury department
The following are advantages of having a specialist centralised treasury department.
(a)

Centralised liquidity management
(i)
(ii)

Avoids having a mix of cash surpluses and overdrafts in different localised bank accounts
Facilitates bulk cash flows, so that lower bank charges can be negotiated

(b)

Larger volumes of cash are available to invest, giving better short-term investment opportunities
(for example money markets, high-interest accounts and CDs).

(c)

Any borrowing can be arranged in bulk, at lower interest rates than for smaller borrowings, and
perhaps on the eurocurrency or eurobond markets.

(d)

Foreign exchange risk management is likely to be improved in a group of companies. A central
treasury department can match foreign currency income earned by one subsidiary with
expenditure in the same currency by another subsidiary. In this way, the risk of losses on adverse
exchange rate movements can be avoided without the expense of forward exchange contracts or
other hedging methods.

(e)

A specialist treasury department can employ experts with knowledge of dealing in forward
contracts, futures, options, eurocurrency markets, swaps, and so on. Localised departments could
not have such expertise.

(f)

The centralised pool of funds required for precautionary purposes will be smaller than the sum of
separate precautionary balances which would need to be held under decentralised treasury
arrangements.

(g)

Through having a separate profit centre, attention will be focused on the contribution to group
profit performance that can be achieved by good cash, funding, investment and foreign currency
management.

Part C Working capital management
w

6: Working capital finance

129

Possible advantages of decentralised cash management are as follows.
(a)

Sources of finance can be diversified and can match local assets.

(b)

Greater autonomy can be given to subsidiaries and divisions because of the closer relationships
they will have with the decentralised cash management function.

(c)

A decentralised treasury function may be more responsive to the needs of individual operating units.

(d)

Since cash balances will not be aggregated at group level, there will be more limited opportunities
to invest such balances on a short-term basis.

4 Cash management models
FAST FORWARD

Optimal cash holding levels can be calculated from formal models, such as the Baumol model and the
Miller-Orr model.
A number of different cash management models indicate the optimum amount of cash that a company
should hold.

4.1 The Baumol model

6/15

The Baumol model is based on the idea that deciding on optimum cash balances is like deciding on
optimum inventory levels. It assumes that cash is steadily consumed over time and a business holds a
stock of marketable securities that can be sold when cash is needed. The cost of holding cash is the
opportunity cost, ie the interest forgone from not investing the cash. The cost of placing an order is the
administration cost incurred when selling the securities.
The Baumol model uses an equation of the same form as the EOQ formula for inventory management
which we looked at earlier.
Similarly to the EOQ, costs are minimised when:

Q

Where S

i
Q

=

the amount of cash to be used in each time period
the cost per sale of securities
the interest cost of holding cash or near cash equivalents
the total amount to be raised to provide for S

4.1.1 Example: Baumol approach to cash management
Finder Co faces a fixed cost of $4,000 to obtain new funds. There is a requirement for $24,000 of cash
over each period of one year for the foreseeable future. The interest cost of new funds is 12% per annum;
the interest rate earned on short-term securities is 9% per annum. How much finance should Finder raise
at a time?

Solution
The cost of holding cash is 12% – 9% = 3%
The optimum level of Q (the 'reorder quantity') is:
2 4,000 24,000
= $80,000
0.03
The optimum amount of new funds to raise is $80,000. This amount is raised every 80,000
years.

24,000 = 31/3


4.1.2 Drawbacks of the Baumol model
The inventory approach illustrated above has the following drawbacks.

Exam focus
point

(a)

In reality, it is unlikely to be possible to predict amounts required over future periods with much
certainty.

(b)

No buffer inventory of cash is allowed for. There may be costs associated with running out of cash.

(c)

There may be other normal costs of holding cash which increase with the average amount held.

The examining team's report for the June 2015 exam noted that many students were unable to correctly
apply the Baumol model to find the optimum amount of short-term investments to convert into cash.
Although the Baumol formula is not on the formula sheet, the EOQ formula is. You need to treat the fixed
cost of getting cash from short-term investments as the ordering cost. You also need to treat the penalty
or opportunity cost of holding cash as the inventory holding cost. If you can't remember this then you
need to memorise the Baumol formula instead.

4.2 The Miller-Orr model
In an attempt to produce a more realistic approach to cash management, various models more
complicated than the inventory approach have been developed. One of these, the Miller-Orr model,
manages to achieve a reasonable degree of realism while not being too elaborate.
We can begin looking at the Miller-Orr model by asking what will happen if there is no attempt to manage
cash balances. Clearly, the cash balance is likely to 'meander' upwards or downwards. The Miller-Orr
model imposes limits to this meandering.
If the cash balance reaches an upper limit (point A) the firm buys sufficient securities to return the cash
balance to a normal level (called the 'return point'). When the cash balance reaches a lower limit (point B),
the firm sells securities to bring the balance back to the return point.

Time

How are the upper and lower limits and the return point set? Miller and Orr showed that the answer to this
question depends on the variance of cash flows, transaction costs and interest rates. If the day to day
variability of cash flows is high or the transaction cost in buying or selling securities is high, then wider
limits should be set. If interest rates are high, the limits should be closer together.
To keep the interest costs of holding cash down, the return point is set at one-third of the distance (or
'spread') between the lower and the upper limit.

To use the Miller-Orr model, it is necessary to follow the steps below.

Step 1

Set the lower limit for the cash balance. This may be zero, or it may be set at some
minimum safety margin above zero.

Step 2

Estimate the variance of cash flows, for example from sample observations over a 100-day
period.

Step 3

Note the interest rate and the transaction cost for each sale or purchase of securities
(the latter is assumed to be fixed).

Step 4

Compute the upper limit and the return point from the model and implement the limits
strategy.

You may be given the information to help you through the early steps, as in the question below.

Question

Miller-Orr model

The following data applies to a company.
1

The minimum cash balance is $8,000.

2

The variance of daily cash flows is 4,000,000, equivalent to a standard deviation of $2,000 per day.

3

The transaction cost for buying or selling securities is $50. The interest rate is 0.025% per day.

You are required to formulate a decision rule using the Miller-Orr model.

The upper limit and return point are now calculated.
Upper limit = lower limit + $25,300 = $8,000 + $25,300 = $33,300
Return point = lower limit + 1/3 spread = $8,000 + 1/3 $25,300 = $16,433, say $16,400
The decision rule is as follows. If the cash balance reaches $33,300, buy $16,900 (= 33,300 16,400) in
marketable securities. If the cash balance falls to $8,000, sell $8,400 of marketable securities for cash.

Exam focus
point

132

Variance = standard deviation2 so if you are given the standard deviation, you will need to square it to
calculate the variance. If you are given the annual interest rate, you will need to divide it by 365 to obtain
the daily interest rate.

The usefulness of the Miller-Orr model is limited by the assumptions on which it is based. In practice,
cash inflows and outflows are unlikely to be entirely unpredictable as the model assumes: for example,
for a retailer, seasonal factors are likely to affect cash inflows.
However, the Miller-Orr model may save management time which might otherwise be spent in responding
to those cash inflows and outflows which cannot be predicted.

5 Investing surplus cash
FAST FORWARD

Temporary surpluses of cash can be invested in a variety of financial instruments. Longer-term surpluses
should be returned to shareholders if there is a lack of investment opportunities.

Companies and other organisations sometimes have a surplus of cash and become 'cash rich'. A cash
surplus is likely to be temporary, but while it exists the company should invest or deposit the cash bearing
the following considerations in mind:
(a)

Liquidity – money should be available to take advantage of favourable short-term interest rates on
bank deposits, or to grasp a strategic opportunity, for example paying cash to take over another
company.

(b)

Profitability – the company should seek to obtain a good return for the risk incurred.

(c)

Safety – the company should avoid the risk of a capital loss.

Other factors that organisations need to consider include:
(a)

Whether to invest at fixed or floating rates. Floating rate investments are likely to be chosen if
interest rates are expected to rise.

(b)

Term to maturity. The terms chosen will be affected by the business's desire for liquidity and
expectations about future rates of interest – if there are major uncertainties about future interest
rate levels it will be better to choose short-term investments. There may also be penalties for early
liquidation.

(c)

How easy it will be to realise the investment.

(d)

Whether a minimum amount has to be invested in certain investments.

(e)

Whether to invest on international markets.

If a company has no plans to grow or to invest, then surplus cash not required for transactions or
precautionary purposes should normally be returned to shareholders.
Surplus cash may be returned to shareholders by:
(a)

Increasing the usual level of the annual dividends which are paid

(b)

Making a one-off special dividend payment (for example, National Power plc and BT plc have
made such payments in recent years)

(c)

Using the money to buy back its own shares from some of its shareholders. This will reduce the
total number of shares in issue, and should therefore raise the level of earnings per share.

If surplus cash is to be invested on a regular basis, organisations should have investment guidelines in
place covering the following issues.
(a)

Surplus funds can only be invested in specified types of investment (eg no equity shares).

(b)

All investments must be convertible into cash within a set number of days.

(c)

Investments should be ranked: surplus funds are to be invested in higher risk instruments only
when a sufficiency has been invested in lower risk items (so that there is always a cushion of
safety).

(d)

If a firm invests in certain financial instruments, a credit rating should be obtained. Credit rating
agencies, discussed earlier, issue gradings according to risk.

Part C Working capital management
w

6: Working capital finance

133

5.1 Short-term investments
Temporary cash surpluses are likely to be:
(a)

Deposited with a bank or similar financial institution

(b)

Invested in short-term debt instruments, such as Treasury bills or CDs (Debt instruments are debt
securities which can be traded.)

(c)

Invested in longer-term debt instruments such as government bonds, which can be sold when the
company eventually needs the cash

(d)

Invested in shares of listed companies, which can be sold on the stock market when the company
eventually needs the cash; investing in equities is fairly high risk, since share prices can fall
substantially, resulting in large losses on investment

5.2 Short-term deposits
Cash can of course be put into a bank deposit to earn interest. The rate of interest obtainable depends on
the size of the deposit, and varies from bank to bank.
There are other types of deposit.
(a)
Money market lending
There is a very large money market in the UK for interbank lending. The interest rates in the market
are related to the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) and the London Interbank Bid Rate (LIBID).
(b)

Local authority deposits
Local authorities often need short-term cash, and investors can deposit funds with them for
periods ranging from overnight up to one year or more.

(c)

Finance house deposits
These are time deposits with finance houses (usually subsidiaries of banks).

5.3 Short-term debt instruments
There are a number of short-term debt instruments which an investor can resell before the debt matures
and is repaid. These debt instruments include certificates of deposit (CDs) and Treasury bills.
These have already been described in the context of money market instruments.

5.3.1 Certificates of deposit (CDs)
A CD is a security that is issued by a bank, acknowledging that a certain amount of money has been
deposited with it for a certain period of time (usually a short term). The CD is issued to the depositor, and
attracts a stated amount of interest.
CDs are negotiable and traded on the CD market (a money market), so if a CD holder wishes to obtain
immediate cash they can sell the CD on the market at any time. This secondhand market in CDs makes
them attractive, flexible investments for organisations with excess cash. A company with a temporary cash
surplus may therefore buy a CD as an investment.

5.3.2 Treasury bills
Treasury bills are issued weekly by the government to finance short-term cash deficiencies in the
government's expenditure programme. They are IOUs issued by the government, giving a promise to pay
a certain amount to their holder on maturity. Treasury bills have a term of 91 days to maturity, after which
the holder is paid the full value of the bill.

The market for Treasury bills is very liquid, and bills can be bought or sold at any time.

Working capital can be funded by a mixture of short- and long-term funding. Businesses should be aware
of the distinction between fluctuating and permanent assets.

6.3 Working capital investment policy
Organisations have to decide what the most important risks relating to working capital are, and therefore
whether to adopt a conservative, aggressive or moderate approach to investment in working capital.

6.3.1 A conservative approach
A conservative working capital investment policy aims to reduce the risk of system breakdown by holding
high levels of working capital.
Customers are allowed generous payment terms to stimulate demand, finished goods inventories are high
to ensure availability for customers, and raw materials and work in progress are high to minimise the risk
of running out of inventory and consequent downtime in the manufacturing process. Suppliers are paid
promptly to ensure their goodwill, again to minimise the chance of stock-outs.
However, the cumulative effect on these policies can be that the firm carries a high burden of unproductive
assets, resulting in a financing cost that can destroy profitability. A period of rapid expansion may also
cause severe cash flow problems, as working capital requirements outstrip available finance. Further
problems may arise from inventory obsolescence and lack of flexibility to customer demands.

6.3.2 An aggressive approach
An aggressive working capital investment policy aims to reduce this financing cost and increase
profitability by cutting inventories, speeding up collections from customers and delaying payments to
suppliers.
The potential disadvantage of this policy is an increase in the chances of system breakdown through
running out of inventory or loss of goodwill with customers and suppliers.

136

6: Working capital finance

Part C Workingg capital
management
w


However, modern manufacturing techniques encourage inventory and work in progress reductions
through just-in-time policies, flexible production facilities and improved quality management. Improved
customer satisfaction through a quality and effective response to customer demand can also mean that
credit periods are shortened.

6.3.3 A moderate approach
A moderate working capital investment policy is a middle way between the aggressive and conservative
approaches.
These characteristics are useful for comparing and analysing the different ways that individual
organisations deal with working capital and the trade-off between risk and return.

6.4 Permanent and fluctuating current assets
In order to understand working capital financing decisions, assets can be divided into three different types.
(a)

Non-current (fixed) assets are long-term assets from which an organisation expects to derive
benefit over a number of periods; for example, buildings or machinery.

(b)

Permanent current assets are the amount required to meet long-term minimum needs and sustain
normal trading activity; for example, inventory and the average level of accounts receivable.

(c)

Fluctuating current assets are the current assets which vary according to normal business activity;
for example, due to seasonal variations.

Fluctuating current assets together with permanent current assets form part of the working capital of the
business, which may be financed by either long-term funding (including equity capital) or by current
liabilities (short-term funding).

6.5 Working capital financing policy

9/16

There are different ways in which the funding of the current and non-current assets of a business can be
achieved by employing long- and short-term sources of funding.
Short-term sources of funding are usually cheaper and more flexible than long-term ones. However,
short-term sources are riskier for the borrower, as interest rates are more volatile in the short term and
they may not be renewed.

The diagram below illustrates three alternative types of policy: A, B and C. The dotted lines A, B and C are
the cut-off levels between short-term and long-term funding for each of the policies A, B and C
respectively: assets above the relevant dotted line are financed by short-term funding while assets below
the dotted line are financed by long-term funding.

non-current assets and permanent current assets, as well as part of the fluctuating current assets,
are financed by long-term funding. There is only a need to call on short-term financing at times
when fluctuations in current assets push total assets above the level of dotted line A. At times when
fluctuating current assets are low and total assets fall below line A, there will be surplus cash
which the company will be able to invest in marketable securities.

(b)

Policy B is a more aggressive approach to financing working capital. Not only are fluctuating
current assets all financed out of short-term sources, but so are some of the permanent current
assets. This policy represents an increased risk of liquidity and cash flow problems, although
potential returns will be increased if short-term financing can be obtained more cheaply than
long-term finance.

(c)

A balance between risk and return might be best achieved by the moderate approach of policy C, a
policy of maturity matching in which long-term funds finance permanent assets while short-term
funds finance non-permanent assets. This means that the maturity of the funds matches the
maturity of the assets.

Don't confuse working capital investment and financing. The amount of working capital that a company
chooses to have is an investment decision whereas the type of financing it uses for its working capital is a
financing decision. In exam questions, many students do not demonstrate knowledge of the conservative,
aggressive and matching approaches to working capital financing.

6.6 Other factors
The trend of overall working capital management will be complicated by the following factors.

138

(a)

Industry norms
These are of particular importance for the management of receivables. It will be difficult to offer a
much shorter credit period than competitors.

(b)

Products
The production process, and therefore the amount of work in progress, is obviously much greater
for some products and in some industries.

(c)

Management issues
How working capital is managed may have a significant impact on the actual length of the working
capital cycle whatever the overall strategy might be. Factors to consider include:

(i)

The size of the organisation

(ii)

The degree of centralisation (which may allow a more aggressive approach to be adopted,
though this depends on how efficient the centralised departments actually are)

(iii)

Management attitudes to risk

(iv)

Previous funding decisions

Chapter Roundup


Cash flow forecasts show the expected receipts and payments during a forecast period and are a vital
management control tool, especially during times of recession.



Cash shortages can be eased by postponing capital expenditure, selling assets, taking longer to pay
accounts payable and pressing accounts receivable for earlier payment.



A large organisation will have a treasury department to manage liquidity, short-term investment,
borrowings, foreign exchange risk and other, specialised areas such as forward contracts and futures.



Optimal cash holding levels can be calculated from formal models, such as the Baumol model and the
Miller-Orr model.



Temporary surpluses of cash can be invested in a variety of financial instruments. Longer-term surpluses
should be returned to shareholders if there is a lack of investment opportunities.



Working capital can be funded by a mixture of short- and long-term funding. Businesses should be aware
of the distinction between fluctuating and permanent assets.

Introduction
This chapter introduces investment appraisal and covers the manner in which
investment opportunities are identified. It also introduces two relatively
straightforward, but widely used, investment appraisal methods: payback
period and return on capital employed. Chapter 8 will look at investment
appraisal using the more sophisticated discounted cash flow (DCF) methods,
which address some of the weaknesses of the traditional approaches covered
in this chapter (make sure you know what these are!).

1 Investment and the capital budgeting process
(Brought forward knowledge)
1.1 Investment
Knowledge brought forward from earlier studies

You should be able to distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure, and between non-current
assets and working capital investment. The following section is for revision only.
Investment can be divided into two categories: capital expenditure and revenue expenditure.
Suppose that a business purchases a building for $30,000. It then adds an extension to the building at a
cost of $10,000. The building needs to have a few broken windows mended, its floors polished and some
missing roof tiles replaced. These cleaning and maintenance jobs cost $900.
The original purchase ($30,000) and the cost of the extension ($10,000) are capital expenditure because
they are incurred to acquire and then improve a non-current asset. The other costs of $900 are revenue
expenditure because they merely maintain the building and thus the earning capacity of the building.

Key terms

Capital expenditure is expenditure which results in the acquisition of non-current assets or an
improvement in their earning capacity. It is not charged as an expense in the statement of profit or loss;
the expenditure appears as a non-current asset in the statement of financial position.
Revenue expenditure is charged to the statement of profit or loss and is expenditure which is incurred:
(a)
(b)

For the purpose of the trade of the business – this includes expenditure classified as selling and
distribution expenses, administration expenses and finance charges
To maintain the existing earning capacity of non-current assets

1.1.1 Non-current asset investment and working capital investment
Investment can be made in non-current assets or working capital.
(a)

146

Investment in non-current assets involves a significant amount of time between the commitment
of funds and recovering the investment. Money is paid out to acquire resources which are going to
be used on a continuing basis within the organisation.
