Not all intermediation takes place between savers and investors. Some institutions act mainly as
intermediaries between other institutions. Financial intermediaries may also lend abroad or borrow from
abroad.

Exam focus
point

Bear in mind that financial markets and institutions are topic areas which the ACCA examining team are
likely to test in Section A of the exam.

1.1.1 Examples of financial intermediaries


Retail banks – offer services to the general public (whether branch-based or online)



Investment (or wholesale) banks – offer services and advice to large clients such as governments
or major organisations



Mutual societies – offer banking facilities to its members and those owned by its members, for
example building societies



Institutional investors such as pension funds (which invest funds built up from pension
contributions), insurance companies (which invest funds built up from insurance policyholders
payments) and investment trusts and unit trusts (investing shareholders money)

1.2 The benefits of financial intermediation

12/16

Financial intermediaries perform the following functions.
(a)

They provide obvious and convenient ways in which a lender can save money. Instead of having to
find a suitable borrower for their money, the lender can deposit their money with a financial
intermediary. All the lender has to do is decide for how long they might want to lend the money,
and what sort of return they require, and they can then choose a financial intermediary that offers a
financial instrument to suit their requirements.

(b)

Financial intermediaries also provide a ready source of funds for borrowers. Even when money is
in short supply, a borrower will usually find a financial intermediary prepared to lend some.

(c)

They can aggregate smaller savings deposited by savers and lend on to borrowers in larger
amounts.

(d)

Risk for individual lenders is reduced by pooling. Since financial intermediaries lend to a large
number of individuals and organisations, any losses suffered through default by borrowers or
capital losses are effectively pooled and borne as costs by the intermediary. Risky investments are
therefore effectively changed into low risk investments for individual investors, this is sometimes
referred to as risk transformation.

(e)

By pooling the funds of large numbers of people, some financial institutions are able to give
investors access to diversified portfolios covering a varied range of different securities, such as
unit trusts and investment trusts.

(f)

Financial intermediaries, most importantly, provide maturity transformation, ie borrowing money
on shorter timeframes than they lend out. They bridge the gap between the wish of most lenders
for liquidity and the desire of most borrowers for loans over longer periods.

2 Financial markets
2.1 Financial markets

Financial markets are the markets where individuals and organisations with surplus funds lend funds to
other individuals and organisations that want to borrow.

DIRECT FINANCE

Those who have saved and are lending funds, the 'lender savers', are on the left, and those who must
borrow funds to finance their spending, the 'borrower spenders', are on the right. The principal
lender-savers are households, as well as overseas institutions and their governments, who sometimes
also find themselves with excess funds and so lend them out. The most important borrower-spenders are
corporations and governments, although individuals also borrow to finance the acquisition of durable
goods or houses. The arrows show that funds flow from lender-savers to borrower-spenders via two
routes.
The first route is the direct finance route at the bottom of the diagram, when borrowers borrow funds
directly from lenders in financial markets by selling them securities (also called financial instruments),
which are claims on the borrowers' future income or assets.
Securities are assets for the buyer but liabilities for the seller. For example, if British Airways needs to
borrow funds to pay for a new aircraft, it might borrow the funds from a saver by selling the saver a loan
note or bond, a debt security that promises to make payments periodically for a specified period of time.
The channelling of funds from savers to spenders is a crucial function for the economy because the
people who save are frequently not the same people who have profitable investment opportunities
available to them, ie the entrepreneurs. Without financial markets, it is hard to transfer funds from a
person with surplus funds and no investment opportunities to one who has investment opportunities but
no funds. They would be unable to transact and both would be worse off as a result. Financial markets are
thus essential to promoting economic efficiency.
Financial markets can be classified in several ways. We will look at the main classifications below in turn.

Short-term lending and borrowing

The money markets are operated by the banks and other financial institutions. Although the money
markets largely involve borrowing and lending by banks, some large companies, as well as the
government, are involved in money market operations.
The primary market is known as the official market, the other markets as the parallel or wholesale
markets.

2.2.2 The capital markets
FAST FORWARD

A stock market (in the UK: the main market plus the Alternative Investment Market (AIM)) acts as a
primary market for raising finance, and as a secondary market for the trading of existing securities.
Securities are tradable financial instruments. They can take the form of equity (such as shares), debt
(such as bonds and loan notes) or derivatives.
Capital markets are markets for trading in long-term finance, in the form of long-term financial
instruments such as equities and corporate bonds or loan notes.

Part B w

61

In the UK, the principal capital markets are:
(a)
(b)

The Stock Exchange 'main market' (for companies with a full stock market listing)
The more loosely regulated 'second tier' Alternative Investment Market (AIM)

Firms obtain long-term or medium-term capital in one of the following ways:
(a)

They may raise share capital. Most new issues of share capital are in the form of ordinary share
capital. Firms that issue ordinary share capital are inviting investors to take an equity stake in the
business, or to increase their existing equity stake.

(b)

They may raise debt capital. Long-term debt capital might be raised in the form of debentures,
corporate bonds, loan notes or convertible bonds.

We will look at sources of long-term finance in more detail in Chapter 12.

2.3 Primary and secondary markets
FAST FORWARD

Primary markets enable organisations to raise new finance. Secondary markets enable investors to buy
and sell existing investments to each other.
The financial markets serve two main purposes.
(a)

As primary markets they enable organisations to raise new finance, by issuing new shares or new
bonds. In the UK, a company must have public company status (be a publicly listed company, or
'plc') to be allowed to raise finance from the public on a capital market.

(b)

As secondary markets they enable existing investors to buy and sell existing investments, should
they wish to do so. The marketability of securities is a very important feature of the capital markets,
because investors are more willing to buy stocks and shares if they know that they could sell them
easily, should they wish to.

Here are two examples of how primary and secondary markets work:


Primary markets: When one company wants to take over another, it is common to do so by
issuing shares to finance the takeover. Takeovers by means of a share exchange are only feasible if
the shares that are offered can be readily traded on a stock market, and so have an identifiable
market value.



Secondary markets: When a company comes to the stock market for the first time, and 'floats' its
shares on the market, the owners of the company can realise some of the value of their shares in
cash, because they will offer a proportion of their personally held shares for sale to new investors.

2.4 Exchange-traded instruments and over the counter markets
FAST FORWARD

Secondary markets may be organised on exchanges or may consist of over the counter (OTC)
transactions.
Secondary markets for financial securities can be organised on exchanges, where buyers and sellers of
securities buy and sell securities in one location, the exchange. Examples of exchanges include the
London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange for the trading of shares, the Chicago Board of
Trade for the trading of commodities and derivatives, and the London International Financial Futures and
Options Exchange (LIFFE) for the trading of derivatives.
Alternatively, secondary markets can operate as over the counter (OTC) markets, where transactions do
not involve buying and selling through an exchange, but customers negotiate individual transactions,
usually with a financial intermediary such as a bank.
Securities that are issued in an over the counter market can be negotiable or non-negotiable.


Negotiable securities can be resold.
Non-negotiable securities cannot be resold.

2.5 Institutional investors
Institutional investors are institutions which have large amounts of funds which they want to invest, and
they will invest in stocks and shares or any other assets which offer satisfactory returns and security or
lend money to companies directly. The institutional investors are the biggest investors in the stock
markets.
The major institutional investors in the UK are pension funds, insurance companies, investment trusts,
unit trusts and venture capital organisations. Of these, pension funds and insurance companies have the
largest amounts of funds to invest.

2.6 Capital market participants
The various participants in the capital markets are summarised in the diagram below.

2.7 Securitisation
FAST FORWARD

12/14

Securitisation is the process of converting illiquid assets into marketable asset-backed securities. The
development of securitisation has led to disintermediation and a reduction in the day to day role of
financial intermediaries, as borrowers can reach lenders directly after securitisation.
Securitisation is the process of converting illiquid assets into marketable securities. These securities are
backed by specific assets and are normally called asset-backed securities (ABS).
The oldest and historically most common type of asset securitisation is the mortgage-backed bond or
security (MBS). Very simplistically, the process is as follows.
(1)

A financial entity can purchase a number of mortgage loans from banks.

(2)

The entity pools the mortgage loans together.

(3)

The entity issues bonds to institutional investors. The money raised from issuing the bonds is used
to pay for the mortgage loans.

(4)

The institutional investors now have the right to receive the principal and interest payments made
on the mortgage.

Today, virtually anything that has a cash flow (for example, a loan, a public works project, or a receivable
balance) is a candidate for securitisation.
The development of securitisation has led to disintermediation and a reduction in the role of financial
intermediaries, as borrowers can reach lenders directly. For example, once banks have securitised
mortgages and sold them on, they have been removed from the link between lender and borrower.

Key term

Disintermediation describes a decline in the traditional deposit and lending relationship between banks
and their customers and an increase in direct relationships between the ultimate suppliers and users of
financing.

3 International money and capital markets
FAST FORWARD

International money and capital markets are available for larger companies wishing to raise larger
amounts of finance.
Larger companies are able to borrow funds on the eurocurrency markets (which are international money
markets) and on the markets for eurobonds (international capital markets).

Exam focus
point

Don't suggest these international markets as possible sources of finance for a smaller business in an
exam answer.

3.1 Eurocurrency markets
A UK company might borrow money from a bank or from the investing public, in sterling. But it might also
borrow in a foreign currency, especially if it trades abroad, or if it already has assets or liabilities abroad
denominated in a foreign currency.
When a company borrows in a foreign currency, the loan is known as a eurocurrency loan.

Key term

Eurocurrency is currency which is held by individuals and institutions outside the country of issue of that
currency.
For example, if a UK company borrows US$50,000 from its bank, the loan will be a 'eurodollar' loan.
London is a major centre for eurocurrency lending and companies with foreign trade interests might
choose to borrow from their bank in another currency.
The eurocurrency markets involve the depositing of funds with a bank outside the country of the currency
in which the funds are denominated and re-lending these funds for a fairly short term, typically three
months. Most eurocurrency transactions in fact take place between banks of different countries and take
the form of negotiable certificates of deposit.

3.2 International bond markets
Large companies may arrange borrowing facilities from their bank, in the form of bank loans or bank
overdrafts. Alternatively, however, they may prefer to borrow from private investors. In other words,
instead of obtaining a £10,000,000 bank loan, a company might issue bonds, in order to borrow directly
from investors, with:
(a)

The bank merely arranging the transaction, finding investors who will take up the bonds that the
borrowing company issues

(b)

Interest being payable to the investors themselves, not to a bank

A strong international market has built up which allows very large companies to borrow in this way, long
term or short term. As well as eurobonds, there is also a less highly developed market in international
equity share issues ('euro-equity').

Key term

A eurobond is a bond denominated in a currency which often differs from that of the country of issue.
Eurobonds are, in effect, long-term loans raised by international companies or other institutions and sold
to investors in several countries at the same time. Such bonds can be sold by one holder to another. The
term of a eurobond issue is typically 10 to 15 years.

64

3: Financial markets, moneyy markets and institutions
Part B Financial management environment
w


Eurobonds may be the most suitable source of finance for a large organisation with an excellent credit
rating, such as a large successful multinational company, which:
(a)

Requires a long-term loan to finance a big capital expansion programme; the loan may be for at
least 5 and up to 20 years

(b)

Requires borrowing which is not subject to the national exchange controls of any government

In addition, domestic capital issues may be regulated by the government or central bank, with an orderly
queue for issues. In contrast, eurobond issues can be made whenever market conditions seem favourable.
A borrower who is contemplating a eurobond issue must consider the exchange risk of a long-term
foreign currency loan. If the money is to be used to purchase assets that will earn revenue in a currency
different to that of the bond issue, the borrower will run the risk of losses from unfavourable exchange
rate movements.
If the money is to be used to purchase assets which will earn revenue in the same currency, the borrower
can match these revenues with payments on the bond, and so remove or reduce the exchange risk.
An investor subscribing to a bond issue will be concerned about the following factors.
(a)
(b)

(c)

(d)

Security
The borrower must be of high quality (ie have a high credit rating).
Marketability
Investors may wish to have a ready market in which bonds can be bought and sold. If the
borrower is of high quality the bonds or notes will be readily negotiable.
Anonymity
Investors in eurobonds tend to be attracted to the potential anonymity of this type of issue, as the
bonds are generally issued to bearer.
The return on the investment
This is often paid tax free.

4 Rates of interest and rates of return
Interest rates are effectively the 'prices' governing lending and borrowing. The borrower pays interest to
the lender at a certain percentage of the capital sum, as the price for the use of the funds borrowed. As
with other prices, supply and demand effects apply. For example, the higher the rates of interest that are
charged, the lower the demand will be for funds from borrowers.

4.1 The pattern of interest rates
FAST FORWARD

Interest rates on financial assets are influenced by the risk of the assets, the duration of the lending and
their maturity.
The pattern of interest rates refers to the variety of interest rates on different financial assets, and the
margin between interest rates on lending and deposits that are set by banks. Note that the pattern of
interest rates is a different thing from the general level of interest rates.
Why are there such a large number of interest rates? In other words, how is the pattern of interest rates to
be explained? The answer to this question relates to several factors.
(a)

Risk
There is a trade-off between risk and return. Higher-risk borrowers must pay higher yields on their
borrowing, to compensate lenders for the greater credit risk involved. Banks will assess the
creditworthiness of the borrower, and set a rate of interest on its loan at a certain mark-up above
its base rate.

(b)

Need to make a profit on re-lending
Financial intermediaries make their profits from re-lending at a higher rate of interest than the cost
of their borrowing. For example, the interest rate charged on bank loans exceeds the rate paid on
deposits and the mortgage rate charged by mutual societies exceeds the interest rate paid on
deposits.
Part B w
Financial management
management environment
3: Financial markets, money markets and institutions

65

(c)

Duration of the lending
The term of the loan or asset will affect the rate of interest charged on it. In general, longer-dated
assets will earn a higher yield than similar short-dated assets but this is not always the case. The
differences in rates are therefore due to the differences in the term structure of interest rates.

(d)

Size of the loan or deposit
The yield on assets might vary with the size of the loan or deposit. Administrative cost savings help
to allow lower rates of interest to be charged by banks on larger loans and higher rates of
interest to be paid on larger time deposits.

(e)

Different types of financial asset
Different types of financial asset attract different rates of interest. This is partly because different
types of asset attract different sorts of lender/investor. For example, bank deposits attract
individuals and companies, whereas long-dated government securities are particularly attractive to
various institutional investors.

The rates of interest paid on government borrowing provide benchmarks for other interest rates. For
example:
(a)
(b)

Key term

Clearing banks might set the three months interbank rate (LIBOR) at about 1% above the Treasury
bill rate.
Banks in turn lend (wholesale) at a rate higher than LIBOR.

LIBOR or the London Interbank Offered Rate is the rate of interest at which banks borrow from each other
in the London interbank market.
We will look at interest rates in more detail in Chapter 20.

4.2 The risk-return trade-off
FAST FORWARD

There is a trade-off between risk and return. Investors in riskier assets expect to be compensated for the
risk. In the case of ordinary shares, investors hope to achieve their return in the form of an increase in the
share price (a capital gain) as well as from dividends.
We have explained how rates of interest, and therefore rates of return to lenders, will be affected by the
risk involved in lending. The idea of a risk-return trade-off can, however, be extended beyond a
consideration of interest rates.
An investor has the choice between different forms of investment. The investor may earn interest by
depositing funds with a financial intermediary who will lend on to, say, a company, or it may invest in
corporate bonds. Alternatively, the investor may invest directly in a company by purchasing shares in it.
The current market price of a security is found by discounting the future expected earnings stream at a
rate suitably adjusted for risk. This means that investments carrying a higher degree of risk will demand a
higher rate of return. This rate of return or yield has two components.




Annual income (dividend or interest)
Expected capital gain

Some of the main forms of investment are listed below in ascending order of risk.

66

(a)

Government bonds
The risk of default is negligible. Hence this tends to form the base level for returns in the market.

(b)

Company bonds or loan notes
Although there is some risk of default on loan notes, they are often secured against corporate
assets.

(c)

Preference shares
These are generally riskier than loan notes since they rank behind debt in the event of a liquidation,

3: Financial markets, moneyy markets and institutions
Part B Financial management environment
w


although they rank ahead of ordinary shares. The return takes the form of a fixed percentage
dividend based on the par value of the share.
(d)

Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares carry a high level of risk. Dividends are paid out of distributable profits after all
other liabilities have been paid and can be subject to large fluctuations from year to year. However,
there is the potential for significant capital appreciation in times of growth. In general, the level of
risk will vary with the operational and financial gearing of the company and the nature of the
markets in which it operates.

4.3 The reverse yield gap

12/14

Because debt involves lower risk than equity investment, we might expect yields on debt to be lower than
yields on shares. More usually, however, the opposite applies and the yields on shares are lower than on
low-risk debt; this situation is known as a reverse yield gap. A reverse yield gap can occur because
shareholders may be willing to accept lower returns on their investment in the short term, in anticipation
that they will make capital gains in the future.

4.4 Interest rates and shareholders' required rates of return
Given that equity shares and interest-earning investments stand as alternatives from the investor's point of
view, changes in the general level of interest rates can be expected to have an effect on the rates of return
which shareholders will expect.
If the return expected by an investor from an equity investment (ie an investment in shares) is 11% and
the dividend paid on the shares is 15 cents every year, the market value of one share will be 15 cents/11%
= $1.36.
Suppose that interest rates on debt investments then fall. The option of putting the funds on deposit has
become less attractive and as a result the shareholders' required return may also fall to, say, 9%. Then the
market value of one share will increase to 15 cents/9% = $1.67.
You can see from this that an increase in the shareholders' required rate of return (perhaps resulting
from an increase in the general level of interest rates) will lead to a fall in the market value of the share.

5 Money market instruments
Performance objective 9 requires you to 'value projects, financial securities and instruments and advise on
their costs and benefits to the organisation'. This section introduces various money market instruments
and how they can be used to cover liabilities. The various features of each instrument will be useful in
practice to determine the best one to use in different situations, not only to cover the risk involved but also
to cover the risk for the required period.
FAST FORWARD

Money market instruments are traded over the counter between institutional investors. They include
interest-bearing instruments, discount instruments and derivatives and can be either negotiable or
non-negotiable.
We looked at money markets in Section 2 above. Money markets are over the counter markets and the
transactions take place between institutions rather than individual investors. Money market instruments

Interest-bearing instruments pay interest. The investor receives face value plus interest at maturity.
Discount instruments do not pay interest. They are issued and traded at a discount to the face value and
they are redeemed at their par value at maturity. The discount is equivalent to interest and is the difference
between the issue price of the instrument and the redemption price at maturity. For example, if a bill is
issued at a price of 98.50, it is issued at a discount of 1.50 and redeemed at maturity at a price of 100.00.
The discount of 1.50 represents interest on the investment of 98.50.
Derivatives allow the buyer and seller to agree today to buy or sell an asset at some time in the future at
an agreed fixed price.

5.1 Money market deposits
Money market deposits are very short-term loans between banks. These deposits can either be fixed
deposits, where the rate of interest and maturity dates are agreed at the time of the transaction, or call
deposits where the interest is variable and the deposit can be terminated if notice is given. The table below

The table quotes two rates. The first figure in each column shows the interest rate at which a bank will
lend money. This is called the offer price. The second number is the rate at which the bank will pay to
borrow money. This is called the bid price. Note that while the convention in London is to quote Offer/Bid,
in most other markets including the US what is quoted is Bid/Offer.
The rate at which banks borrow from each other in the London market is of particular importance for the
money market. This is called LIBOR and is the most widely used reference rate for short-term interest
rates globally for the settlement of money market derivatives. LIBOR rates are calculated for ten currencies
including the US dollar, pound sterling and the euro. The following table shows examples of LIBOR rates

5.2 Certificates of deposit
Key term

A certificate of deposit (CD) is a certificate of receipt for funds deposited at a bank (or other financial
institution) for a specified term and paying interest at a specified rate.
Certificates of deposit can be either negotiable or non-negotiable. The holder of a negotiable CD has two
options: to hold it until maturity, receiving the interest and the principal, or to sell it before maturity at the
market price. A typical range of dollar certificates of deposit in terms of coupon and maturity is shown
below, together with the corresponding yield.

The coupon is expressed as an annual percentage rate and needs to be adjusted to reflect the fact that its
maturity is less than a year. Sterling CDs assume there are 365 days in the year, while US CDs assume
360 days. For example, if the coupon on three-month US dollar CDs is 5.950%, this means that the
interest payment after three months will be (one quarter) 1.4875%. Converting this to an annual
percentage yield:

Key term

A repurchase agreement is an agreement between two counterparties under which one counterparty
agrees to sell a financial instrument to the other on an agreed date for an agreed price, and simultaneously
agrees to buy back the instrument from the counterparty at a later date for an agreed higher price.
A repurchase agreement is in effect a loan secured by a marketable financial instrument, usually a treasury
bill or a bond. The typical term is up to 180 days but is often much shorter. It is an attractive instrument
because it can accommodate a wide spectrum of short-term maturities. A repo involves two sets of
transactions.

A company enters into a repo agreement with a bank and it sells $10,000,000 of government bonds with
an obligation to repurchase the security in 60 days. If the repo rate is 8.2% what is the repurchase price of
the bond? Assume a 365-day year.

Answer
The repurchase price of the bonds is the sale price plus the interest on the cash received.

Interest

$10,000,000 0.082

60
365

= $134,794.52

Repurchase price = $10,000,000 + $134,794.52 = $10,134,794.52

Key term

A reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) is an agreement for the purchase of an instrument with
the simultaneous agreement to resell the instrument at an agreed future date and agreed price.
In a reverse repo, the dealer purchases the security initially and then sells it on maturity. Because the two
parties in a repo agreement act as a buyer and a seller of the security, a repo to one party is a reverse
repo to the other.

5.4 Treasury bills
Treasury bills are debt instruments issued by the government with maturities ranging from one month to
one year. Most are issued with a maturity of 91 days.

5.5 Commercial paper
Commercial paper (CP) is short-term unsecured corporate debt with maturity up to 270 days. The typical
term of this debt is 30 or 60 days. Commercial paper can only be issued by large organisations with good
credit ratings, normally to fund short-term expenditure.

A bank organises a CP programme for a large company with a duration of several years. Within the term
of the programme, the company can make issues of CP, up to the maximum limit permitted by the
programme. The bank administers the programme for its corporate client, selling each issue of CP and
repaying the CP investors at redemption date.
CP is issued at a discount that reflects the prevailing interest rates.

5.6 Banker's acceptance
Key term

Banker's acceptances (BAs) are negotiable bills guaranteed by a bank.
Banker's acceptances are issued by firms to finance commercial transactions, such as imports or the
purchase of goods.

A bill of exchange is a short-term debt instrument that is issued ('drawn') by one person on another (the
'drawee'). When issued it is in effect a 'You Owe Me' instrument. The bill is then accepted by the drawee
(who notifies acceptance by signing the bill), when it becomes a promise to pay – an 'I Owe You'.
A BA is a bill of exchange accepted by a bank. By accepting the bill, the bank is making a promise to pay. If
the bank is well established, a BA therefore has low credit risk.
A bank may agree to accept bills on behalf of a client in a BA acceptance facility. The client has to repay
the bank for the payments made by the bank to settle its BAs, but is financed by the bank between the time
of accepting the bill and the time of its settlement.
The drawer of the bill can hold the bill until maturity, when the bank will settle the bill and make the
payment. Alternatively the drawer can sell the bill to another investor at a discount, to raise immediate
cash. The bank then pays the bill holder at maturity.
The name 'banker's acceptance' derives from the fact that the bank has guaranteed the payment to the
holder of the banker's acceptance; that is, the bank has accepted responsibility for the payment. Banks
guarantee the payment by the company for a fee.
Banker's acceptances are sold on a discounted basis, like T-bills and commercial paper. Because banker's
acceptances are negotiable instruments, they can be bought and sold until they mature. The rates on
banker's acceptances are low because, as they are guaranteed by a bank, the credit risk is low.
UK Banker's Acceptance are calculated on a Actual/365 days basis while in the US they are calculated on
an Actual/360 days basis.
The typical term of BAs is 30 to 180 days.

5.7 Futures, forwards and options
Imagine a farmer growing a crop of wheat. To grow such a crop costs money: money for seed, labour,
fertiliser, and so on. All this expenditure takes place with no certainty that when the crop is eventually
harvested the price at which the wheat is sold will cover these costs. This is obviously a risky thing to do
and many farmers will be unwilling to take on this burden. How can this uncertainty be avoided?
By using futures or options, the farmer will be able to agree today a price at which the crop will ultimately
be sold, in perhaps four or six months' time. This enables the farmer to achieve a minimum sale price for
their crop. They are no longer subject to fluctuations in wheat prices. They know what price their wheat
will bring and can thus plan their business accordingly.
From their origins in the agricultural world, futures and options have become available on a wide range of
other assets, from commodities, such as metals and crude oil, to financial products, such as currencies,
bonds and equities. To understand futures and options properly requires some application. There is much
terminology to master, and definitions to be understood, but at heart they are really quite simple. They are

products which allow you to fix today the price at which assets may be bought or sold at a future date.
Futures and options are sometimes called derivatives, as their price is derived from an underlying asset.

5.7.1 Futures
A future is an agreement to buy or sell a standard quantity of a specified asset on a fixed future date at a
price agreed today. As they are standardised, they can be and are exchange traded.
There are two parties to a futures contract, namely a buyer and a seller.



The buyer of a future enters into an obligation to buy on a specified future date.
The seller of a future is under an obligation to sell on a specified future date.

These obligations relate to a standard quantity of a specified asset on a fixed future date at a price
agreed today. These details of the future contract are contained within the contract specification.

5.7.2 Forwards
A forward is an agreement over the counter (ie off-exchange) between two parties to make or take delivery
of an asset for an agreed price at a future date. In principal, then, the nature of the transaction is very
similar to a futures contract. However, because this is an 'over the counter' transaction between two
parties, all terms of the contract can be tailored individually to meet the buyer's and seller's needs.
The key advantage of forwards is that they allow much greater flexibility to suit particular circumstances.
This will enable a hedger to tailor their derivative hedge to their exact requirements. (Hedging is a way of
protecting against financial loss by making an investment to reduce the risk of an uncertain market.)
The main disadvantages are a lack of liquidity in comparison to exchange-traded futures, and increased
credit risk for both buyer and seller, as there is no clearing house to act as a central counterparty. This is
known as counterparty risk.

5.7.3 Options
An option is a contract that confers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a given price
(exercise price or strike price) on or before a given date. Options are entered into at a cost, called the
premium.
The right to buy is known as a call option.
The right to sell is known as a put option.

Chapter Roundup


A financial intermediary links those with surplus funds (eg lenders) to those with fund deficits (eg
potential borrowers) thus providing aggregation and economies of scale, risk pooling and maturity
transformation.



Financial markets are the markets where individuals and organisations with surplus funds lend funds to
other individuals and organisations that want to borrow.



Capital markets are markets for medium-term and long-term capital.



Money markets are markets for short-term capital.



A stock market (in the UK: the main market plus the Alternative Investment Market (AIM)) acts as a
primary market for raising finance, and as a secondary market for the trading of existing securities.



Securities are tradable financial instruments. They can take the form of equity (such as shares), debt
(such as bonds and loan notes) or derivatives.



Primary markets enable organisations to raise new finance. Secondary markets enable investors to buy
and sell existing investments to each other.



Secondary markets may be organised on exchanges or may consist of over the counter (OTC)
transactions.



Securitisation is the process of converting illiquid assets into marketable asset-backed securities. The
development of securitisation has led to disintermediation and a reduction in the day to day role of
financial intermediaries, as borrowers can reach lenders directly after securitisation.



International money and capital markets are available for larger companies wishing to raise larger
amounts of finance.



Interest rates on financial assets are influenced by the risk of the assets, the duration of the lending and
their maturity.



There is a trade-off between risk and return. Investors in riskier assets expect to be compensated for the
risk. In the case of ordinary shares, investors hope to achieve their return in the form of an increase in the
share price (a capital gain) as well as from dividends.



Money market instruments are traded over the counter between institutional investors. They include
interest-bearing instruments, discount instruments and derivatives and can be either negotiable or
non-negotiable.

1.1 Working capital characteristics of different businesses
Different businesses will have different working capital characteristics. There are three main aspects to
these differences.
(a)

Holding inventory (from their purchase from external suppliers, through the production and
warehousing of finished goods, up to the time of sale)

(b)

Taking time to pay suppliers and other accounts payable (creditors)

(c)

Allowing customers (accounts receivable) time to pay

Here are some examples.

Exam focus
point

(a)

Supermarkets and other retailers receive much of their sales in cash or by credit card or debit card.
However, they typically buy from suppliers on credit. They may therefore have the advantage of
significant cash holdings, which they may choose to invest.

(b)

A company which supplies to other companies, such as a wholesaler, is likely to be selling and
buying mainly on credit. Co-ordinating the flow of cash may be quite a problem. Such a company
may make use of short-term borrowings (such as an overdraft) to manage its cash.

(c)

Smaller companies with a limited trading record may face particularly severe problems. Lacking a
long track record, such companies may find it difficult to obtain credit from suppliers. At the same
time, customers will expect to receive the length of credit period that is normal for the particular
business concerned. The firm may find itself squeezed in its management of cash.

Some aspect of working capital management is likely to be included in every exam.

2 Objectives of working capital management
FAST FORWARD

12/14, 9/16

The two main objectives of working capital management are to ensure that it has sufficient liquid
resources to continue in business and to increase its profitability.
Every business needs adequate liquid resources to maintain day to day cash flow such as wages and
payments to suppliers.
Liquidity can be maintained by ensuring that the amounts of cash tied up in inventory and receivables is
not excessive.
However, if a business dramatically cut its inventory and receivables (ie adopts an aggressive approach to
working capital management) then this may lead to trading problems, and lower profits. Here are some
examples of problems from having levels of working capital that are too low.
(a)

Low inventory may mean that delivery lead times to customers are excessively high, or that a
business does not have enough inventory to meet peaks in demand. This is likely to lead to lost
sales.

(b)

Having low receivables implies that a business's credit terms are stringent and that long credit
periods are not being made available to its customers. Again, in some industries, this may lead to
lost sales.

So, the objectives of liquidity and profitability may conflict.
However, if the levels of inventory and receivables are high because working capital is not being managed
well, then more professional management of the warehouse (to keep inventory lower) and of credit control
(to keep receivables lower) may allow both higher liquidity and higher profitability.
So, the objectives of liquidity and profitability are not always in conflict.
