1 The nature and purpose of financial management
FAST FORWARD

Financial management decisions cover investment decisions, financing decisions, dividend decisions and
risk management.

1.1 What is financial management?
Financial management can be defined as the management of the finances of an organisation in order to
achieve the financial objectives of the organisation. The usual assumption in financial management for the
private sector is that the objective of the company is to maximise shareholders' wealth.

1.2 Financial planning
The financial manager will need to plan to ensure that enough funding is available at the right time to meet
the needs of the organisation for short-, medium- and long-term capital.
(a)

In the short term, funds may be needed to pay for purchases of inventory, or to smooth out
changes in receivables, payables and cash: the financial manager must ensure that working capital
requirements (ie requirements for day to day operations) are met.

(b)

In the medium or long term, the organisation may have planned purchases of non-current assets,
such as plant and equipment, for which the financial manager must ensure that funding is
available.

The financial manager contributes to decisions on the uses of funds raised by analysing financial data to
determine uses which meet the organisation's financial objectives. Is project A to be preferred over
project B? Should a new asset be bought or leased?

1.3 Financial control
The control function of the financial manager becomes relevant for funding which has been raised. Are the
various activities of the organisation meeting its objectives? Are assets being used efficiently? To answer
these questions, the financial manager may compare data on actual performance with forecast
performance. Forecast data will have been prepared in the light of past performance (historical data)
modified to reflect expected future changes. Future changes may include the effects of economic
development, for example an economic recovery leading to a forecast upturn in revenues.

1.4 Financial management decisions

12/14

The financial manager makes decisions relating to investment, financing and dividends. The
management of risk must also be considered.
Investments in assets must be financed somehow. Financial management is also concerned with the
management of short-term funds and with how funds can be raised over the long term.
The retention of profits is a financing decision. The other side of this decision is that if profits are retained,
there is less to pay out to shareholders as dividends, which might deter investors. An appropriate balance
needs to be struck in addressing the dividend decision: how much of its profits should the company pay
out as dividends and how much should it retain for investment to provide for future growth and new
investment opportunities?
We shall be looking at various aspects of the investment, financing and dividend decisions of financial
management throughout this Study Text.
