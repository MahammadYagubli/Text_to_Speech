Question

Disposal of surplus assets

'The financial manager should identify surplus assets and dispose of them'. Why?

Answer
A surplus asset earns no return for the business. The business is likely to be paying the 'cost of capital' in
respect of the money tied up in the asset, ie the money which it can realise by selling it.
If surplus assets are sold, the business may be able to invest the cash released in more productive ways,
or alternatively it may use the cash to cut its liabilities. Either way, it will enhance the return on capital
employed for the business as a whole.
Although selling surplus assets yields short-term benefits, the business should not jeopardise its activities
in the medium or long term by disposing of productive capacity until the likelihood of it being required in
the future has been fully assessed.

1.5 Management accounting, financial accounting and financial
management

9/16

Of course, it is not just people within an organisation who require information. Those external to the
organisation, such as banks, shareholders, tax authorities, trade payables and government agencies, all
desire information too.
Management accountants provide internally used information. The financial accounting function
provides externally used information. The management accountant is not concerned with the calculation
of earnings per share for the statement of profit or loss and the financial accountant is not concerned with
the variances between budgeted and actual labour expenditure.
Management information provides a common source from which financial accounts and management
accounts are prepared. The differences between the two types of accounts arise in the manner in which
the common source of data is analysed.

Financial accounts

Management accounts

Financial accounts detail the performance of an
organisation over a defined period and the state
of affairs at the end of that period.

Management accounts are used to aid
management to record, plan and control activities
and to help the decision-making process.

Limited companies must, by law, prepare financial
accounts.

There is no legal requirement to prepare
management accounts.

Financial accounts

Management accounts

The format of published financial accounts is
determined by law and by accounting standards.
In principle the accounts of different organisations
can therefore be easily compared.

The format of management accounts is entirely at
management discretion: no strict rules govern the
way they are prepared or presented.

Financial accounts concentrate on the business as
a whole, aggregating revenues and costs from
different operations, and are an end in themselves.

Management accounts can focus on specific areas
of an organisation's activities. Information may aid
a decision rather than be an end product of a
decision.

Most financial accounting information is of a
monetary nature.

Management accounts incorporate non-monetary
measures.

Financial accounts present an essentially historic
picture of past operations.

Management accounts are both a historical record
and a future planning tool.

As we have seen, financial management is the management of finance. Finance is used by an
organisation just as, for example, labour is used by an organisation. Finance therefore needs management
in a similar way to labour. The management accounting function provides information to ensure the
effective management of labour and, in the same way, the financial management function provides
information on, for example, projected cash flows to aid the effective management of finance.

2 Financial objectives and the relationship with
corporate strategy
FAST FORWARD

Strategy is a course of action to achieve an objective. There are three main levels of strategy in an
organisation.




Corporate: the general direction of the whole organisation
Business: how the organisation or its business units tackle particular markets
Operational/functional: specific strategies for different departments of the business

2.1 Strategy
Strategy may be defined as a course of action, including the specification of resources required, to
achieve a specific objective.
Strategy can be short term or long term, depending on the time horizon of the objective it is intended to
achieve.
This definition also indicates that since strategy depends on objectives or targets, the obvious starting
point for a study of strategy is the identification and formulation of objectives.

2.2 Corporate objectives
FAST FORWARD

Corporate objectives are relevant for the organisation as a whole, relating to key factors for business
success.
Corporate objectives are those which are concerned with the firm as a whole. Objectives should be
explicit, quantifiable and capable of being achieved. The corporate objectives outline the expectations of
the firm and the strategic planning process is concerned with the means of achieving the objectives.






Profitability (return on investment)

Cash flow
Customer satisfaction
The quality of the firm's products
Industrial relations

2.3 Financial objectives
FAST FORWARD

Financial targets may include targets for: earnings; earnings per share; dividend per share; gearing
level; profit retention; operating profitability.
The usual assumption in financial management for the private sector is that the primary financial objective
of the company is to maximise shareholders' wealth.

2.3.1 Shareholder wealth maximisation

12/14, 6/15, 12/16

If the financial objective of a company is to maximise the value of the company, and in particular the value
of its ordinary shares, we need to be able to put values on a company and its shares. How do we do it?
Three possible methods for the valuation of a company might occur to us.
(a)

Statement of financial position (balance sheet) valuation
Here assets will be valued on a going concern basis. Certainly, investors will look at a company's
statement of financial position. If retained profits rise every year, the company will be a profitable
one. Statement of financial position values are not a measure of 'market value', although retained
profits might give some indication of what the company could pay as dividends to shareholders.

(b)

Break-up basis
This method of valuing a business is only of interest when the business is threatened with
liquidation, or when its management is thinking about selling off individual assets to raise cash.

(c)

Market values
The market value is the price at which buyers and sellers will trade stocks and shares in a company. This
is the method of valuation which is most relevant to the financial objectives of a company.
(i)

(ii)

When shares are traded on a recognised stock market, such as the stock exchange, the
market value of a company can be measured by the price at which shares are currently
being traded.
When shares are in a private company, and are not traded on any stock market, there is no
easy way to measure their market value. Even so, the financial objective of these companies
should be to maximise the wealth of their ordinary shareholders.

The wealth of the shareholders in a company comes from:




Dividends received
Market value of the shares

A shareholder's return on investment is obtained in the form of:




Dividends received
Capital gains from increases in the market value of their shares

If a company's shares are traded on a stock market, the wealth of shareholders is increased when the
share price goes up. The price of a company's shares will go up when the company makes attractive
profits, which it pays out as dividends or reinvests in the business to achieve future profit growth and
8

w


dividend growth. However, to increase the share price the company should achieve its attractive profits
without taking business risks and financial risks which worry shareholders.
If there is an increase in earnings and dividends, management can hope for an increase in the share price
too, so that shareholders benefit from both higher revenue (dividends) and also capital gains (higher
share prices). Total shareholder return is a measure which combines the increase in share price and
dividends paid and can be calculated as:
(P1 P0 D1)/P0

Where P0 is the share price at the beginning of the period
P1 is the share price at the end of period
D1 is the dividend paid

Question

Total shareholder return

A shareholder purchased 1,000 shares in SJG Co on 1 January at a market price of $2.50 per share. On
31 December the shares had an ex-div market value of $2.82 per share. The dividend paid during the
period was $0.27 per share. What is the total shareholder return and what are the elements of total
shareholder return?

Answer
The total shareholder return is:
($2.82 – $2.50 + $0.27)/$2.50 = 0.24 or 24%
This is made up of the capital gain (P1 – P0)/P0 = ($2.82 – $2.50)/$2.50 = 0.13 or 13%
and the dividend yield D1/P0 = $0.27/$2.50 = 0.11 or 11%

Exam focus
point

Students often forget to use P0 as the denominator when calculating the total shareholder return. The start
of the period share price needs to be used, as the return being calculated is the return on the share price
paid at the start of the period.
Management should set targets for factors which they can influence directly, such as profits and dividend
growth. A financial objective might be expressed as the aim of increasing profits, earnings per share and
dividend per share by, say, 10% a year for each of the next five years.

2.3.2 Profit maximisation

12/14

In much economic theory, it is assumed that the firm behaves in such a way as to maximise profits,
where profit is viewed in an economist's sense. Unlike the accountant's concept of cost, total costs by this
economist's definition include an element of reward for the risk-taking of the entrepreneur, called 'normal
profit'.
Where the entrepreneur is in full managerial control of the firm, as in the case of a small owner-managed
company or partnership, the economist's assumption of profit maximisation would seem to be very
reasonable. Remember though that the economist's concept of profits is broadly in terms of cash,
whereas accounting profits may not equate to cash flows.
Even in companies owned by shareholders but run by non-shareholding managers, if the manager is
serving the company's (ie the shareholders') interests, we might expect that the profit maximisation
assumption should be close to the truth.
Although profits do matter, they are not the best measure of a company's achievements.
(a)

Accounting profits are not the same as 'economic' profits. Accounting profits can be manipulated
to some extent by choices of accounting policies.

Question

Manipulation of profits

Can you give three examples of how accounting profits might be manipulated?

Answer
Here are some examples you might have chosen.
(a)
(b)
(c)

Provisions, such as provisions for depreciation or anticipated losses
The capitalisation of various expenses, such as development costs
Adding overhead costs to inventory valuations

(b)

Profit does not take account of risk. Shareholders will be very interested in the level of risk, and
maximising profits may be achieved by increasing risk to unacceptable levels.

(c)

Profits on their own take no account of the volume of investment that it has taken to earn the
profit. Profits must be related to the volume of investment to have any real meaning. Hence
measures of financial achievement include:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

(d)

Accounting return on capital employed
Earnings per share
Yields on investment, eg dividend yield as a percentage of stock market value

Profits are reported every year (with half-year interim results for quoted companies). They are
measures of short-term performance, whereas a company's performance should ideally be judged
over the longer term.

2.3.3 Earnings per share growth
Key term

6/15

Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by
the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Earnings per share (EPS) is widely used as a measure of a company's performance and is of particular
importance in comparing results over a period of several years. A company must be able to sustain its
earnings in order to pay dividends and reinvest in the business so as to achieve future growth. Investors also
look for growth in the EPS from one year to the next.

Note that:
(a)
(b)

EPS is a figure based on past data, and
It is easily manipulated by changes in accounting policies and by mergers or acquisitions.

The use of the measure in calculating management bonuses makes it particularly liable to manipulation.
For example, EPS can be increased via a share consolidation (exchanging a number of existing shares for
one new share without altering the total value of the shareholding). The attention given to EPS as a
performance measure by City analysts is arguably disproportionate to its true worth. Investors should be
more concerned with future earnings, but of course estimates of these are more difficult to reach than the
readily available figure.

11

2.3.4 Other financial targets
In addition to targets for earnings, EPS and dividend per share, a company might set other financial
targets, such as:
(a)

A restriction on the company's level of gearing, or debt. For example, a company's management
might decide:
(i)
(ii)

The ratio of long-term debt capital to equity capital should never exceed, say, 1:1.
The cost of interest payments should never be higher than, say, 25% of total profits before
interest and tax.

(b)

A target for profit retentions. For example, management might set a target that dividend cover
(the ratio of distributable profits to dividends actually distributed) should not be less than, say, 2.5
times.

(c)

A target for operating profitability. For example, management might set a target for the profit/sales
ratio (say, a minimum of 10%) or for a return on capital employed (say, a minimum ROCE of
20%).

These financial targets are not primary financial objectives, but they can act as subsidiary targets or
constraints which should help a company to achieve its main financial objective without incurring
excessive risks. They are usually measured over a year rather than over the long term.
Remember, however, that short-term measures of return can encourage a company to pursue short-term
objectives at the expense of long-term ones, for example by deferring new capital investments, or
spending only small amounts on research and development and on training. A major problem with setting
a number of different financial targets, either primary targets or supporting secondary targets, is that they
might not all be consistent with each other. When this happens, some compromises will have to be
accepted.

2.3.5 Example: Financial targets
Lion Grange Co has recently introduced a formal scheme of long-range planning. Sales in the current year
reached $10,000,000, and forecasts for the next five years are $10,600,000, $11,400,000, $12,400,000,
$13,600,000 and $15,000,000. The ratio of net profit after tax to sales is 10%, and this is expected to
continue throughout the planning period. Total assets less current liabilities will remain at around 125% of
sales. Equity in the current year is $8,750,000.
It was suggested at a recent board meeting that:
(a)

If profits rise, dividends should rise by at least the same percentage.

(b)

An earnings retention rate of 50% should be maintained ie a payment ratio of 50%.

(c)

The ratio of long-term borrowing to long-term funds (debt plus equity) is limited (by the market) to
30%, which happens also to be the current gearing level of the company.

You are required to prepare a financial analysis of the draft long-range plan.

* Given maximum gearing of 30% and no new issue of shares = funds available minus net assets required.

Question

Dividends and gearing

Suggest policies on dividends, retained earnings and gearing for Lion Grange, using the data above.

Answer
The financial objectives of the company are not compatible with each other. Adjustments will have to be
made.
(a)

Given the assumptions about sales, profits, dividends and net assets required, there will be an
increasing shortfall of funds from year 2 onwards, unless new shares are issued or the gearing
level rises above 30%.

(b)

In years 2 and 3, the shortfall can be eliminated by retaining a greater percentage of profits, but
this may have a serious adverse effect on the share price. In years 4 and 5, the shortfall in funds
cannot be removed even if dividend payments are reduced to nothing.

(c)

The net asset turnover (sales/capital employed) appears to be low. The situation would be eased if
investments were able to generate a higher volume of sales, so that fewer non-current assets and
less working capital would be required to support the projected level of sales.

(d)

If asset turnover cannot be improved, it may be possible to increase the profit to sales ratio by
reducing costs or increasing selling prices.

(e)

If a new issue of shares is proposed to make up the shortfall in funds, the amount of funds
required must be considered very carefully. Total dividends would have to be increased in order to
pay dividends on the new shares. The company seems unable to offer prospects of suitable
dividend payments, and so raising new equity might be difficult.

(f)

It is conceivable that extra funds could be raised by issuing new debt capital, so that the level of
gearing would be over 30%. It is uncertain whether investors would be prepared to lend money so
as to increase gearing. If more funds were borrowed, profits after interest and tax would fall so that
the share price might also be reduced.

2.4 Non-financial objectives
A company may have important non-financial objectives which must be satisfied in order to ensure the
continuing participation of all stakeholders. Without their participation, financial objectives such as
maximising shareholder wealth may be compromised in the future. Examples of non-financial objectives
are as follows.
(a)

The welfare of employees
A company might try to provide good wages and salaries, comfortable and safe working
conditions, good training and career development, and good pensions. If redundancies are
necessary, many companies will provide generous redundancy payments, or spend money trying
to find alternative employment for redundant staff.

(b)

The welfare of management
Managers will often take decisions to improve their own circumstances, even though their
decisions will incur expenditure and so reduce profits. High salaries, company cars and other perks
are all examples of managers promoting their own interests.

(c)

The provision of a service
The major objectives of some companies will include fulfilment of a responsibility to provide a
service to the public. Examples are the privatised British Telecom and British Gas. Providing a
service is of course a key responsibility of government departments and local authorities.

(d)

The fulfilment of responsibilities towards customers
Responsibilities towards customers include providing in good time a product or service of a quality
that customers expect, and dealing honestly and fairly with customers. Reliable supply
arrangements and after-sales service arrangements are important.

(e)

The fulfilment of responsibilities towards suppliers
Responsibilities towards suppliers are expressed mainly in terms of trading relationships. A
company's size could give it considerable power as a buyer. The company should not use its power
unscrupulously. Suppliers might rely on receiving prompt payment, in accordance with the agreed
terms of trade.

(f)

The welfare of society as a whole
The management of some companies are aware of the role that their company has to play in
exercising corporate social responsibility. This includes compliance with applicable laws and
regulations but is wider than that. Companies may be aware of their responsibility to minimise
pollution and other harmful 'externalities' (such as excessive traffic) which their activities generate.
In delivering 'green' environmental policies, a company may improve its corporate image as well as
reducing harmful externality effects. Companies also may consider their 'positive' responsibilities,
for example to make a contribution to the community by local sponsorship.

Other non-financial objectives are growth, diversification and leadership in research and development.
Non-financial objectives do not negate financial objectives, but they do suggest that the simple theory of
company finance, that the objective of a firm is to maximise the wealth of ordinary shareholders, is too
narrow. Financial objectives may have to be compromised in order to satisfy non-financial objectives.

3 Stakeholders
FAST FORWARD

14

Stakeholders are individuals or groups who are affected by the activities of the firm. They can be
classified as internal (employees and managers), connected (shareholders, customers and suppliers) and
external (local communities, pressure groups, government).

1: Financial management and financial objectives
Part A Financial
Financial management function
w


Key term

There is a variety of different groups or individuals whose interests are directly affected by the activities of
a firm. These groups or individuals are referred to as stakeholders in the firms.
The various stakeholder groups in a firm can be classified as follows.
Stakeholder groups
Internal

Employees and pensioners
Managers
Directors

Connected

Shareholders
Debt holders (bondholders)
Customers
Bankers
Suppliers
Competitors

External

Government
Pressure groups
Local and national communities
Professional and regulatory bodies

3.1 Objectives of stakeholder groups
The various groups of stakeholders in a firm will have different goals which will depend in part on the
particular situation of the enterprise. Some of the more important aspects of these different goals are as
follows.
(a)

Ordinary (equity) shareholders

(b)

Ordinary (equity) shareholders are the providers of the risk capital of a company. Usually their goal
will be to maximise the wealth which they have as a result of the ownership of the shares in the
company.
Trade payables (creditors)

(c)

Trade payables have supplied goods or services to the firm. Trade payables will generally be
profit-maximising firms themselves and have the objective of being paid the full amount due by the
date agreed. On the other hand, they usually wish to ensure that they continue their trading
relationship with the firm and may sometimes be prepared to accept later payment to avoid
jeopardising that relationship.
Long-term payables (creditors)
Long-term payables, which will often be banks, have the objective of receiving payments of interest
and capital on the loan by the due date for the repayments. Where the loan is secured on assets of
the company, the lender will be able to appoint a receiver to dispose of the company's assets if the
company defaults on the repayments. To avoid the possibility that this may result in a loss to the
lender if the assets are not sufficient to cover the loan, the lender will wish to minimise the risk of
default and will not wish to lend more than is prudent.

(d)

Employees
Employees will usually want to maximise their rewards paid to them in salaries and benefits,
according to the particular skills and the rewards available in alternative employment. Most
employees will also want continuity of employment.

(e)

Government
Government has objectives which can be formulated in political terms. Government agencies
impinge on the firm's activities in different ways including through taxation of the firm's profits, the
provision of grants, health and safety legislation, training initiatives, and so on. Government

Part A Financial management function
1: Financial management
managemen and financial objectives
w

15

policies will often be related to macroeconomic objectives, such as sustained economic growth and
high levels of employment.
(f)

Management
Management has, like other employees (and managers who are not directors will normally be
employees), the objective of maximising its own rewards. Directors, and the managers to whom they
delegate responsibilities, must manage the company for the benefit of shareholders. The objective
of reward maximisation might conflict with the exercise of this duty.

3.2 Stakeholder groups, strategy and objectives
The actions of stakeholder groups in pursuit of their various goals can exert influence on strategy and
objectives. The greater the power of the stakeholder, the greater their influence will be. Each stakeholder
group will have different expectations about what it wants, and the expectations of the various groups
may conflict. Each group, however, will influence strategic decision making.

3.3 Shareholders and management

9/16

Although ordinary shareholders (equity shareholders) are the owners of the company to whom the board
of directors are accountable, the actual powers of shareholders tend to be restricted, except in companies
where the shareholders are also the directors. The day to day running of a company is the responsibility of
management. Although the company's results are submitted for shareholders' approval at the annual
general meeting (AGM), there is often apathy and acquiescence in directors' recommendations.
Shareholders are often ignorant about their company's current situation and future prospects. They have
no right to inspect the books of account, and their forecasts of future prospects are gleaned from the
annual report and accounts, stockbrokers, investment journals and daily newspapers. The relationship
between management and shareholders is sometimes referred to as an agency relationship, in which
managers act as agents for the shareholders.

Key term

Agency relationship: a description of the relationship between management and shareholders expressing
the idea that managers act as agents for the shareholder, using delegated powers to run the company in
the shareholders' best interests.
However, if managers hold none or very few of the equity shares of the company they work for, what is to
stop them from working inefficiently?
One power that shareholders possess is the right to remove the directors from office. But shareholders
have to take the initiative to do this and, in many companies, the shareholders lack the energy and
organisation to take such a step. Even so, directors will want the company's report and accounts, and the
proposed final dividend, to meet with shareholders' approval at the AGM.
Another reason why managers might do their best to improve the financial performance of their company
is that managers' pay is often related to the size or profitability of the company. Managers in very big
companies, or in very profitable companies, will normally expect to earn higher salaries than managers in
smaller or less successful companies. There is also an argument for giving managers some profit-related
pay, or providing incentives which are related to profits or share price. We will come back to this in
Section 5 of this chapter.

3.4 Shareholders, managers and the company's long-term creditors
The relationship between long-term creditors (payables) of a company, the management and the
shareholders of a company encompasses the following factors.

16

(a)

Management may decide to raise finance for a company by taking out long-term or medium-term
loans or issuing loan notes in the case of larger companies. They might well be taking risky
investment decisions using outsiders' money to finance them.

(b)

Investors who provide debt finance will rely on the company's management to generate enough net
cash inflows to make interest payments on time, and eventually to repay loans.

1: Financial management and financial objectives
Part A Financial
Financial management function
w


However, long-term creditors will often take security for their loan, perhaps in the form of a fixed
charge over an asset (such as a mortgage on a building). Loan notes are also often subject to
certain restrictive covenants, which restrict the company's rights to borrow more money until the
loan notes have been repaid.
If a company is unable to pay what it owes its creditors, the creditors may decide to exercise their
security or perhaps eventually apply for the company to be wound up.
(c)

The money that is provided by long-term creditors will be invested to earn profits, and the profits
(in excess of what is needed to pay interest on the borrowing) will provide extra dividends or
retained profits for the shareholders of the company. In other words, shareholders will expect to
increase their wealth using creditors' money.

3.5 Shareholders, managers and government
The government does not have a direct interest in companies (except for those in which it actually holds
shares). However, the government does often have a strong indirect interest in companies' affairs.
(a)

Taxation

(b)

The government raises taxes on sales and profits and on shareholders' dividends. It also expects
companies to act as tax collectors for income tax and sales tax (VAT). The tax structure might
influence investors' preferences for either dividends or capital growth.
Encouraging new investments
The government might provide funds towards the cost of some investment projects. It might also
encourage private investment by offering tax incentives.

(c)

Encouraging a wider spread of share ownership

(d)

In the UK, the government has made some attempts to encourage more private individuals to
become company shareholders by means of attractive privatisation issues (such as in the
electricity, gas and telecommunications industries) and tax incentives, such as tax-free savings
accounts (Individual Savings Accounts or ISAs) to encourage individuals to invest in shares.
Legislation

(e)

The government also influences companies, and the relationships between shareholders,
creditors, management, employees and the general public through legislation, including the
Companies Acts, legislation on employment, health and safety regulations, legislation on consumer
protection and consumer rights and environmental legislation.
Economic policy
A government's economic policy will affect business activity. For example, exchange rate policy
will have implications for the revenues of exporting firms and for the purchase costs of importing
firms. Policies on economic growth, inflation, employment, interest rates, and so on are all
relevant to business activities.

4 Measuring the achievement of corporate objectives
FAST FORWARD

Performance measurement is a part of the system of financial control of an enterprise as well as being
important to investors.

4.1 Measuring financial performance

6/15

As part of the system of financial control in an organisation, it will be necessary to have ways of
measuring the progress of the enterprise, so that managers know how well the company is doing. A
common means of doing this is through ratio analysis, which is concerned with comparing and
quantifying relationships between financial variables, such as those variables found in the statement of
financial position and statement of profit or loss of the enterprise.

Exam focus
point

The ACCA examining team has said, more than once, that knowledge of how to calculate and interpret key
ratios is a weak point for many candidates. Make sure that it is one of your strong points. In reviewing
ratio analysis below, we are in part revising material included in previous exams.

4.2 The broad categories of ratios
Ratios can be grouped into the following four categories.





Profitability and return
Debt and gearing
Liquidity
Shareholders' investment ratios ('stock market ratios')

The key to obtaining meaningful information from ratio analysis is comparison: comparing ratios over a
number of periods within the same business to establish whether the business is improving or declining,
and comparing ratios between similar businesses to see whether the company you are analysing is
better or worse than average within its own business sector.

4.3 Ratio pyramids
The Du Pont system of ratio analysis involves constructing a pyramid of interrelated ratios as shown
below.
Return on equity

Such ratio pyramids help in providing for an overall management plan to achieve profitability, and allow
the interrelationships between ratios to be checked.

4.4 Profitability
A company ought of course to be profitable if it is to maximise shareholder wealth, and obvious checks on
profitability are:
(a)
(b)

Whether the company has made a profit or a loss on its ordinary activities
By how much this year's profit or loss is bigger or smaller than last year's profit or loss

Profit before taxation is generally thought to be a better figure to use than profit after taxation, because
there might be unusual variations in the tax charge from year to year which would not affect the
underlying profitability of the company's operations.
Another profit figure that should be considered is profit before interest and tax (PBIT). This is the amount
of profit which the company earned before having to pay interest to the providers of loan capital. This is
also a good measure of operating profit, the profit that the company is making from its business
operations. By providers of loan capital, we usually mean longer-term loan capital, such as loan notes and
medium-term bank loans.

4.4.1 Profitability and return: the return on capital employed
You cannot assess profits or profit growth properly without relating them to the amount of funds
(the capital) employed in making the profits. The most important profitability ratio is therefore return on
capital employed (ROCE), also called return on investment (ROI).

Formulae to
learn

Return on capital employed =

PBIT
Capital employed

Capital employed = Shareholders' funds plus long-term liabilities
= Total assets less current liabilities

4.4.2 Evaluating the ROCE
What does a company's ROCE tell us? What should we be looking for? There are three comparisons that
can be made.
(a)

The change in ROCE from one year to the next

(b)

The ROCE being earned by other companies, if this information is available

(c)

A comparison of the ROCE with current market borrowing rates (warning: this needs to be
interpreted with care, as ROCE will often reflect higher risk than borrowing rates)
(i)

(ii)

What would be the cost of extra borrowing to the company if it needed more loans, and is it
earning a ROCE that suggests it could make high enough profits to make such borrowing
worthwhile?
Is the company making a ROCE which suggests that it is making profitable use of its
current borrowing?

4.4.3 Secondary ratios
We may analyse the ROCE by looking at the kinds of interrelationships between ratios used in ratio
pyramids, which we mentioned earlier. We can thus find out why the ROCE is high or low, or better or
worse than last year. Profit margin and asset turnover together explain the ROCE, and if the ROCE is the
primary profitability ratio, these other two are the secondary ratios. The relationship between the three
ratios is as follows.
Profit margin

asset turnover = ROCE

PBIT
Sales revenue

Sales revenue
Capital employed

PBIT
Capital employed

It is also worth commenting on the change in revenue (turnover) from one year to the next. Strong sales
growth will usually indicate volume growth as well as revenue increases due to price rises, and volume
growth is one sign of a prosperous company.

Exam focus
point

Remember that capital employed is not just shareholders' funds. It is shareholders' funds plus long-term
liabilities.

4.4.4 Return on equity
Another measure of the firm's overall performance is return on equity. This compares net profit after tax
with the equity that shareholders have invested in the firm.

Formula to
learn

Return on equity =

Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders
Shareholders' equity

Part A Financial management function

managemen and financial objectives
w

19

This ratio shows the earning power of the shareholders' book investment and can be used to compare two
firms in the same industry. A high return on equity could reflect the firm's good management of expenses
and ability to invest in profitable projects. However, it could also reflect a higher level of debt finance
(gearing) with associated higher risk (see Section 4.5).
Note that shareholders' equity includes reserves and is not limited to the ordinary share account.

4.4.5 Gross profit margin, the net profit margin and profit analysis
Depending on the format of the statement of profit or loss, you may be able to calculate the gross profit
margin and also the net profit margin. Looking at the two together can be quite informative.

4.4.6 Example: Profit margins
A company has the following summarised statements of profit or loss for two consecutive years.
Year 1
$
70,000
42,000
28,000
21,000
7,000

Sales revenue
Less cost of sales
Gross profit
Less expenses
Net profit

Year 2
$
100,000
55,000
45,000
35,000
10,000

Although the net profit margin is the same for both years at 10%, the gross profit margin is not.
In year 1 it is:

28,000
70,000

40% and in year 2 it is:

45,000
100,000

45%

Is this good or bad for the business? An increased profit margin must be good because this indicates a
wider gap between selling price and cost of sales. However, given that the net profit ratio has stayed the
same in the second year, expenses must be rising. In year 1 expenses were 30% of revenue, whereas in
year 2 they were 35% of revenue. This indicates that administration or selling and distribution expenses
may require tighter control.
A percentage analysis of profit between year 1 and year 2 is as follows.

Cost of sales as a % of sales
Gross profit as a % of sales
Expenses as a % of sales
Net profit as a % of sales
Gross profit as a % of sales

4.5 Debt and gearing ratios
Debt ratios are concerned with how much the company owes in relation to its size and whether it is getting
into heavier debt or improving its situation. Financial gearing (often simply referred to as 'gearing') is the
amount of debt finance a company uses relative to its equity finance.
(a)

When a company is heavily in debt, and seems to be getting even more heavily into debt, banks
and other would-be lenders are very soon likely to refuse further borrowing.

(b)

When a company is earning only a modest profit before interest and tax, and has a heavy debt
burden, there will be very little profit left over for shareholders after the interest charges have been
paid.

The main debt and gearing ratios are covered in Chapter 15.

4.6 Liquidity ratios: cash and working capital
Profitability is of course an important aspect of a company's performance, and debt or gearing is another.
Neither, however, directly addresses the key issue of liquidity. A company needs liquid assets so that it
can meet its debts when they fall due. The main liquidity ratios will be described in Chapter 4.

4.7 Shareholders' investment ratios
FAST FORWARD

Indicators such as dividend yield, EPS, P/E ratio and dividend cover can be used to assess investor
returns.
Returns to shareholders are obtained in the form of dividends received and/or capital gains from
increases in market value.

A company will only be able to raise finance if investors think that the returns they can expect are
satisfactory in view of the risks they are taking. We must therefore consider how investors appraise
companies. We will concentrate on quoted companies.
Information that is relevant to market prices and returns is available from published stock market
information, and in particular from certain stock market ratios.

Key terms

Cum dividend or cum div means the purchaser of shares is entitled to receive the next dividend payment.
Ex dividend or ex div means that the purchaser of shares is not entitled to receive the next dividend
payment.
The relationship between the cum-div price and the ex-div price is:
Market price per share (ex div) = Market price per share (cum div) – forthcoming dividend per share.
When stock market share prices are quoted, shares go from being cum div to ex div on a given day, and
shareholders buying the shares from the time they go ex div are not entitled to the next dividend pay-out,
which will happen soon.

4.7.1 The dividend yield
Formula to
learn

Dividend yield =

Dividend per share
Ex-divmarket priceper share

The dividend yield is the return a shareholder is currently expecting on the shares of a company.
(a)
(b)

The dividend per share is taken as the dividend for the previous year.
Ex div means that the share price does not include the right to the most recent dividend.

Shareholders look for both dividend yield and capital growth. Obviously, dividend yield is therefore an
important aspect of a share's performance.

Question

Dividend yield

In the year to 30 September 20X8, an advertising agency declares an interim ordinary dividend of 7.4c per
share and a final ordinary dividend of 8.6c per share. Assuming an ex-div share price of 315 cents, what is
the dividend yield?

Answer
The total dividend per share is (7.4 + 8.6) = 16 cents

4.7.2 Earnings per share (EPS)
Formula to
learn

Earnings per share =

Profit distributable to ordinary shareholders
Weighted average number of ordinary shares

The use of earnings per share was discussed in Section 2.3.3 of this chapter.

4.7.3 The price earnings ratio
Formula to
learn

Price earnings ratio =

Market price of share
EPS

The price earnings (P/E) ratio is a useful yardstick for assessing the relative worth of a share.
This is the same as:
Total market value of equity
Total earnings
The value of the P/E ratio reflects the market's appraisal of the share's future prospects. It is an
important ratio because it relates two key considerations for investors, the market price of a share and its
earnings capacity.

4.7.4 Example: Price earnings ratio
A company has recently declared a dividend of 12c per share. The share price is $3.72 cum div and
earnings for the most recent year were 30c per share. Calculate the P/E ratio.

Solution
P/E ratio =

MV ex div
EPS

$3.60
30c

12

The ex-div price should be used, as this reflects the underlying value of the share.

4.7.5 Changes in EPS: the P/E ratio and the share price
An approach to assessing what share prices ought to be, which is often used in practice, is a P/E ratio
approach.
(a)

The relationship between the EPS and the share price is measured by the P/E ratio.

(b)

The P/E ratio tends to change gradually and is reasonably consistent between companies operating
in similar businesses.
So if the EPS goes up or down, the share price should be expected to move up or down too, and
the new share price will be the new EPS multiplied by the constant P/E ratio.

(c)

For example, if a company had an EPS last year of 30c and a share price of $3.60, its P/E ratio would have
been 12. If the current year's EPS is 33c, we might expect that the P/E ratio would remain the same, 12,
and so the share price ought to go up to 12 33c = $3.96.

Question

Shareholder ratios

The directors of X are comparing some of the company's year-end statistics with those of Y, the
company's main competitor. X has had a fairly normal year in terms of profit but Y's latest profits have
been severely reduced by an exceptional loss arising from the closure of an unsuccessful division. Y has a
considerably higher level of financial gearing than X.

In the course of the discussion a number of comments are made, including those given below.
Required

Discuss comments (a) to (d), making use of the above data where appropriate.
(a)
'There is something odd about the P/E ratios. Y has had a particularly bad year. Its P/E should
surely be lower than ours.'
(b)
'One of the factors which may explain Y's high P/E is the high financial gearing.'
(c)
'The comparison of our own P/E ratio and dividend yield with those of Y is not really valid. The
shares of the two companies have different nominal values.'
(d)
'These figures will not please our shareholders. The dividend yield is below the return an investor
could currently obtain on risk-free government bonds.'

Answer
(a)

P/E ratio

The P/E ratio measures the relationship between the market price of a share and the earnings per
share. Its calculation involves the use of the share price, which is a reflection of the market's
expectations of the future earnings performance, and the historic level of earnings.
If Y has just suffered an abnormally bad year's profit performance which is not expected to be
repeated, the market will price the share on the basis of its expected future earnings. The earnings
figure used to calculate the ratio will be the historical figure which is lower than that forecast for
the future, and thus the ratio will appear high.
(b)

Financial gearing

The financial gearing of the firm expresses the relationship between debt and equity in the capital
structure. A high level of gearing means that there is a high ratio of debt to equity. This means that
the company carries a high fixed interest charge, and thus the amount of earnings available to
equity will be more variable from year to year than in a company with a lower gearing level. Thus
the shareholders will carry a higher level of risk than in a company with lower gearing. All other
things being equal, it is therefore likely that the share price in a highly geared company will be
lower than that in a low geared firm.
The historical P/E ratio is dependent on the current share price and the historical level of
earnings. A high P/E ratio is therefore more likely to be found in a company with low gearing than
in one with high gearing. In the case of Y, the high P/E ratio is more probably attributable to the
depressed level of earnings than to the financial structure of the company.

(c)

Comparison of ratios

The ratios are calculated as follows.
=

Market share price
Earnings per share

Dividend yield =

Dividend per share
Market share price

P/E ratio

Even if the shares have a nominal value (which isn't the case in every country) this nominal value
is irrelevant in calculating the ratios. This can be proved by calculating the effect on the ratios of a
share split – the ratios will be unchanged. Thus if all other factors (such as accounting conventions
used in the two firms) are equal, a direct comparison of the ratios is valid.

(d)

Comparison with risk-free securities

As outlined in (c) above, the dividend yield is the relationship between the dividend per share and
the current market price of the share. The market price of the share reflects investor expectations
about the future level of earnings and growth. If the share is trading with a low dividend yield, this
means that investors have positive growth expectations after taking the level of risk into account.
Although government bonds carry little risk, they are unlikely to offer significant growth potential
either, and this means that the share will still be more attractive even after the low dividend yield
has been taken into account.

5 Encouraging the achievement of stakeholder
objectives

9/16

5.1 Managerial reward schemes
FAST FORWARD

It is argued that management will only make optimal decisions if they are monitored and appropriate
incentives are given.
The agency relationship arising from the separation of ownership from management is sometimes
characterised as the 'agency problem'. For example, if managers hold none or very little of the equity
shares of the company they work for, what is to stop them from working inefficiently, not bothering to
look for profitable new investment opportunities or giving themselves high salaries and perks?

Key term

Goal congruence is accordance between the objectives of agents acting within an organisation and the
objectives of the organisation as a whole.

Goal congruence may be better achieved and the 'agency problem' better dealt with by offering
organisational rewards (more pay and promotion) for the achievement of certain levels of performance.
The conventional theory of reward structures is that if the organisation establishes procedures for formal
measurement of performance, and rewards individuals for good performance, individuals will be more
likely to direct their efforts towards achieving the organisation's goals.
Examples of such remuneration incentives are:
(a)

Performance-related pay

Pay or bonuses are usually related to the size of profits, but other performance indicators may be
used.
(b)

Rewarding managers with shares

This might be done when a private company 'goes public' and managers are invited to subscribe
for shares in the company at an attractive offer price. In a management buy-out or buy-in (the
latter involving purchase of the business by new managers; the former by existing managers),
managers become owner-managers.
24

1: Financial management and financial objectives
Part A Financial
Financial management function
w


Shares and share options are also often included as part of the remuneration package for
employees and managers in listed businesses. Ideally these will be given in many small tranches to
incentivise building value over time.
(c)

Executive share option plans (ESOPs)

In a share option scheme, selected employees are given a number of share options, each of which
gives the holder the right after a certain date to subscribe for shares in the company at a fixed
price. The value of an option will increase if the company is successful and its share price goes up.

5.1.1 Beneficial consequences of linking reward schemes and performance
(a)

Performance-related pay may give individuals an incentive to achieve a good performance level.

(b)

Effective schemes also succeed in attracting and keeping the employees that are valuable to the
organisation.

(c)

By tying an organisation's key performance indicators to a scheme, it is clear to all employees what
level of performance is expected of them and helps communicate their role in attempting to create
organisational success.

(d)

By rewarding performance, an effective scheme creates an organisation focused on continuous
improvement.

(e)

Schemes based on shares can motivate employees/managers to act in the long-term interests of
the organisation by doing things to increase the organisation's market value.

5.1.2 Problems associated with reward schemes
(a)

A serious problem that can arise is that performance-related pay and performance evaluation
systems can encourage dysfunctional behaviour. Many investigations have noted the tendency of
managers to pad their budgets either in anticipation of cuts by superiors or to make subsequent
variances more favourable.

(b)

Perhaps of even more concern are the numerous examples of managers making decisions that are
contrary to the wider purposes of the organisation.

(c)

Schemes designed to ensure long-term achievements (that is, to combat short-termism or
myopic management) may not motivate since effort and reward are too distant in time from each
other (or managers may not think they will be around that long!).

(d)

It is questionable whether any performance measures or set of measures can provide a
comprehensive assessment of what a single person achieves for an organisation. There will
always be a lack of goal congruence, employees being committed to what is measured, rather than
the objectives of the organisation.

(e)

Self-interested performance may be encouraged at the expense of teamwork.

(f)

High levels of output (whether this is number of calls answered or production of product X) may be
achieved at the expense of quality.

(g)

In order to make bonuses more accessible, standards and targets may have to be lowered, with
knock-on effects on quality.

(h)

They undervalue intrinsic rewards (which reflect the satisfaction that an individual experiences
from doing a job and the opportunity for growth that the job provides) given that they promote
extrinsic rewards (bonuses and so on).

5.2.1 Corporate governance
FAST FORWARD

Key term

Good corporate governance involves ensuring the effectiveness of risk management and internal control,
accountability to shareholders and other stakeholders, and conducting business in an ethical and
effective way.
Corporate governance is the system by which organisations are directed and controlled.

There are a number of key elements in corporate governance.
(a)

The management and reduction of risk is a fundamental issue in all definitions of good
governance, whether explicitly stated or merely implied.

(b)

The notion that overall performance is enhanced by good organisational structures and
management practice within set best practice guidelines underpins most definitions.

(c)

Good governance provides a framework for an organisation to pursue its strategy in an ethical and
effective way from the perspective of all stakeholder groups affected, and offers safeguards
against misuse of resources, physical or intellectual.

(d)

Good governance is not just about externally established codes but also requires a willingness to
apply the spirit as well as the letter of the law.

(e)

Accountability is generally a major theme in all governance frameworks.

Corporate governance codes of good practice generally cover the following areas.

26

(a)

The board should be responsible for taking major policy and strategic decisions.

(b)

Directors should have a mix of skills and their performance should be assessed regularly.

(c)

Appointments should be conducted by formal procedures administered by a nomination
committee.

(d)

Division of responsibilities at the head of an organisation is most simply achieved by separating
the roles of chairman and chief executive.

(e)

Independent non-executive directors have a key role in governance. Their number and status
should mean that their views carry significant weight.

(f)

Directors' remuneration should be set by a remuneration committee consisting of independent
non-executive directors.

(g)

Remuneration should be dependent on organisation and individual performance.

(h)

Accounts should disclose remuneration policy and (in detail) the packages of individual directors.

(i)

Boards should regularly review risk management and internal control, and carry out a wider
review annually, the results of which should be disclosed in the accounts.

(j)

Audit committees of independent non-executive directors should liaise with external auditors,
supervise internal audit, and review the annual accounts and internal controls.

(k)

The board should maintain a regular dialogue with shareholders, particularly institutional
shareholders. The annual general meeting is a significant forum for communication.

(l)

Annual reports must convey a fair and balanced view of the organisation. This might include
whether the organisation has complied with governance regulations and codes, and give specific
disclosures about the board, internal control reviews, going concern status and relations with
stakeholders.

5.2.2 Stock exchange listing regulations
FAST FORWARD

A stock exchange employs rules and regulations to ensure that the stock market operates fairly and
efficiently for all parties involved.
A stock exchange is an organisation that provides a marketplace in which to trade shares. It also sets rules
and regulations to ensure that the stock market operates both efficiently and fairly for all parties involved.
The stock exchange operates as two different markets.


It is a market for issuers who wish to raise equity capital by offering shares for sale to investors
(a primary market). Such companies are listed on the stock exchange.



It is also a market for investors who can buy and sell shares at any time, without directly affecting
the entities in which they are buying the shares (a secondary market).

To be listed on a stock exchange, a stock must meet the listing requirements laid down in the listing rules
in its approval process.

6 Not for profit organisations
FAST FORWARD

Not for profit and public sector organisations have their own objectives, generally concerned with
achieving specified objectives effectively and efficiently.

6.1 Not for profit sectors
Although most people would know one if they saw it, there is a surprising problem in clearly defining what
counts as a not for profit (NFP) organisation. Local authority services, for example, would not be setting
objectives in order to arrive at a profit for shareholders, but nowadays they are being increasingly required
to apply the same disciplines and processes as companies which are oriented towards straightforward
profit goals.

Case Study
Oxfam operates around 750 shops in Britain, and these operate at a profit. The Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds owns and operates an internet and mail order trading company which operates
profitably and effectively.

The not for profit sector may involve a number of different kinds of organisation with, for example,
differing legal status – charities, statutory bodies offering public transport or the provision of services
such as leisure, health or public utilities.
The tasks of setting objectives and developing strategies and controls for their implementation can all help
in improving the performance of charities and NFP organisations.

6.2 Objectives
The primary objective of many NFP organisations will be the effective provision of a service, not the
creation of profit. This has implications for reporting of results. The organisation will need to be open and
honest in showing how it has managed its budget and allocated funds raised. Efficiency and effectiveness
are particularly important in the use of donated funds, but there is a danger that resource efficiency
becomes more important than service effectiveness.
Here are some possible objectives for a NFP organisation.
(a)
(b)

Surplus maximisation (equivalent to profit maximisation eg a charity shop)
Revenue maximisation (as for a commercial business eg a charity shop)

Full/partial cost recovery (minimising subsidy)
Budget maximisation (maximising what is offered)
Producer satisfaction maximisation (satisfying the wants of staff and volunteers)
Client satisfaction maximisation (the police generating the support of the public)

6.3 Value for money
FAST FORWARD

12/16

Value for money is getting the best possible combination of services from the least resources.

It is reasonable to argue that not for profit organisations best serve society's interests when the gap
between the benefits they provide and the cost of providing those benefits is greatest. This is commonly
termed value for money and is not dissimilar from the concept of profit maximisation, apart from the fact
that society's interests are being maximised rather than profit.

Key term

Value for money can be defined as getting the best possible combination of services from the least
resources, which means maximising the benefits for the lowest possible cost.

This is usually accepted as requiring the application of economy, effectiveness and efficiency (sometimes
known as the 3Es).
(a)
(b)
(c)

Economy (spending money frugally)
Efficiency (getting out as much as possible for what goes in)
Effectiveness (getting done, by means of (a) and (b), what was supposed to be done)

More formally, these criteria can be defined as follows.

Key terms

Economy is attaining the appropriate quantity and quality of inputs at the lowest cost to achieve a certain
level of outputs.
Efficiency is the relationship between inputs and outputs.
Effectiveness is the extent to which declared objectives/goals are met.

6.4 Example: Economy, efficiency, effectiveness
(a)
(b)
(c)

Economy. This dimension relates to the cost of inputs. Economy within a school could be
measured, for example, by comparing average salaries per teacher with earlier years and budgets.
Efficiency. The efficiency with which a school's IT laboratory is used might be measured in terms
of the proportion of the school week for which it is used.
Effectiveness. The effectiveness of a school's objective to produce quality teaching could be
measured by the proportion of students going on to higher or further education.

6.5 Performance measures
Value for money as a concept assumes that there is a yardstick against which to measure the overall
performance of an organisation. It can be difficult to determine where there is value for money, however.

28

(a)

Not for profit organisations tend to have multiple objectives, so that even if they can all be clearly
identified it is impossible to say which is the overriding objective.

(b)

Outputs can seldom be measured in a way that is generally agreed to be meaningful. (Are good
exam results alone an adequate measure of the quality of teaching? How does one quantify the
easing of pain following a successful operation?) For example, in a publicly funded healthcare
system, success may be measured in terms of fewer patient deaths per hospital admission, shorter
waiting lists for operations, average speed of patient recovery, and so on.

Here are a number of possible solutions to these problems.
(a)

Performance can be judged in terms of inputs. This is very common in everyday life. If somebody
tells you that their suit cost $750, for example, you would generally conclude that it was an
extremely well-designed and good quality suit, even if you did not think so when you first saw it.
The drawback, of course, is that you might also conclude that the person wearing the suit had been
cheated or was a fool, or you may think that no piece of clothing is worth $750. It is similar with
the inputs and outputs of a non profit seeking organisation.

(b)

Accept that performance measurement must to some extent be subjective. Judgements can be
made by experts.

(c)

Most not for profit organisations do not face competition but this does not mean that they are all
unique. Bodies like local governments, health services, and so on can compare their performance
against each other and against the historical results of their predecessors. Unit cost
measurements like 'cost per patient day' or 'cost of borrowing one library book' can be established
to allow organisations to assess whether they are doing better or worse than their counterparts.
Care must be taken not to read too much into limited information, however.

6.6 Example: Performance measures
Although output of not for profit organisations is difficult to measure in a way that is generally agreed to
be meaningful, it is not impossible. Outputs of a university might be measured in terms of the following.
Broader performance measures







Proportion of total undergraduate population attending the university (by subject)
Proportion of students graduating and classes of degrees obtained
Amount of private sector research funds attracted
Number of students finding employment after graduation
Number of publications/articles produced by teaching staff

Operational performance measures







Unit costs for each operating 'unit'
Staff: student ratios; staff workloads
Class sizes
Availability of computers; good library stock
Courses offered

6.7 Example: Inputs and outputs
Suppose that at a cost of $40,000 and 4,000 hours (inputs) in an average year, two policemen travel
8,000 miles and are instrumental in 200 arrests (outputs). A large number of possibly meaningful
measures can be derived from these few figures, as the table below shows.

Financial management decisions cover investment decisions, financing decisions, dividend decisions and
risk management.



Strategy is a course of action to achieve an objective. There are three main levels of strategy in an
organisation.

–
–
–

Corporate: the general direction of the whole organisation
Business: how the organisation or its business units tackle particular markets
Operational/functional: specific strategies for different departments of the business



Corporate objectives are relevant for the organisation as a whole, relating to key factors for business
success.



Financial targets may include targets for: earnings; earnings per share; dividend per share; gearing
level; profit retention; operating profitability.
The usual assumption in financial management for the private sector is that the primary financial objective
of the company is to maximise shareholders' wealth.



Stakeholders are individuals or groups who are affected by the activities of the firm. They can be
classified as internal (employees and managers), connected (shareholders, customers and suppliers) and
external (local communities, pressure groups, government).



Performance measurement is a part of the system of financial control of an enterprise as well as being
important to investors.



Indicators such as dividend yield, EPS, P/E ratio and dividend cover can be used to assess investor
returns.



It is argued that management will only make optimal decisions if they are monitored and appropriate
incentives are given.



The achievement of stakeholder objectives can be enforced using regulatory requirements such as
corporate governance codes of best practice and stock exchange listing regulations.



Good corporate governance involves ensuring the effectiveness of risk management and internal control,
accountability to shareholders and other stakeholders, and conducting business in an ethical and
effective way.

Introduction
A business will strive to achieve its objectives, but it has to do so in an
economy which the government will try to steer to achieve its own objectives.
In this chapter we're moving away from the microeconomics of the individual
business to the macroeconomics of the economy as a whole. The business
(and you as an individual) will need to understand how government policies
can impact on different aspects of the economy, and the implications for the
business's own activities and future plans.
The main macroeconomic policy tools we will look at are fiscal, monetary,
interest rate, and exchange rate policy. We will also look at the impact that
specific government policies have on businesses.

1 Outline of macroeconomic policy
FAST FORWARD

Macroeconomic policy involves:




Policy objectives – the ultimate aims of economic policy
Policy targets – quantified levels or ranges which policy is intended to achieve
Policy instruments – the tools used to achieve objectives

Achievement of economic growth, low inflation, full employment and balance of payments stability are
policy objectives.
Policy targets might be set for economic growth or the rate of inflation, for example.

1.1 Microeconomics, macroeconomics and economic policy
Key terms

Microeconomics is concerned with the economic behaviour of individual firms and consumers or
households.
Macroeconomics is concerned with the economy at large, and with the behaviour of large aggregates
such as the national income, the money supply and the level of employment.
A government is concerned with how the economy is behaving as a whole, and therefore with
macroeconomic variables.
Macroeconomic policy can affect planning and decision-making in various ways, for example via interest
rate changes, which affect borrowing costs and required rates of return.
Note also that a government might adopt policies which try to exert influence at the microeconomic level.
Examples include policies to restrict the maximum hours an individual can work or the imposition of a
minimum wage.

1.2 Economic policies and objectives

12/14

The policies pursued by a government may serve various objectives.

Economic
growth

Control inflation

AIMS

Balance of
payments stability

Full
employment

(a)

Economic growth
'Growth' implies an increase in national income in 'real' terms (increases caused by price inflation
are not real increases at all). It is usually interpreted as a rising standard of living.

(b)

Control price inflation
This means managing price inflation to a low, stable level. Inflation is viewed as a problem
because, if a country has a higher rate of inflation than its major trading partners, its exports will
become relatively expensive. It leads to a redistribution of income and wealth in ways which may
be undesirable. In times of high inflation, substantial labour time is spent on planning and
implementing price changes.

(c)

Full employment
Full employment does not mean that everyone who wants a job has one all the time, but it does
mean that unemployment levels are low, and involuntary unemployment is short term.

(d)

Balance of payments stability
The wealth of a country relative to others, a country's creditworthiness as a borrower, and the
goodwill between countries in international relations might all depend on the achievement of an
external trade balance over time. Deficits in external trade, with imports exceeding exports, might
also be damaging for the prospects of economic growth.

39

To try to achieve its objectives, a government will use a number of different policy tools or policy
instruments. These include the following.
(a)

Monetary policy
Monetary policy aims to influence monetary variables such as the rate of interest and the money
supply in order to achieve targets set for employment, inflation, economic growth and the balance
of payments.

(b)

Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy involves using government spending and taxation in order to influence aggregate
demand in the economy.

(c)

Exchange rate policy
Some economists argue that economic objectives can be achieved through management of the
exchange rate by the government. The strength or weakness of sterling's value, for example, will
influence the volume of UK imports and exports, the balance of payments and interest rates.

(d)

External trade policy
A government might have a policy for promoting economic growth by stimulating exports; for
example, by managing the exchange rate to make exports cheaper for foreign purchasers. Another
argument is that there should be import controls to provide some form of protection for domestic
manufacturing industries by making the cost of imports higher and the volume of imports lower.
Protection could encourage domestic output to rise, stimulating the domestic economy.

These policy tools are not mutually exclusive and a government might adopt a policy mix of monetary
policy, fiscal policy and exchange rate policy and external trade policy in an attempt to achieve its
intermediate and ultimate economic objectives.

1.3 Conflicts in policy objectives and instruments
Macroeconomic policy aims cannot necessarily all be sustained together for a long period of time;
attempts to achieve one objective will often have adverse effects on others, sooner or later.
(a)

There may be a conflict between steady balanced growth in the economy and full employment.
Although a growing economy should be able to provide more jobs, there is some concern that
since an economy must be modernised to grow and modern technology is labour saving, it might
be possible to achieve growth without creating many more jobs, and so keeping unemployment at
a high level.

(b)

In the UK, problems with creating more employment and steady growth in the economy have
been a lack of domestic and global demand following the global financial crisis, the balance of
payments, the foreign exchange value of sterling, inflation and the money supply. The objectives of
lower unemployment and economic growth have been difficult to achieve because of the problems
and conflicts with secondary objectives.
(i)

To create jobs and growth, there must be an increase in aggregate demand. When demand
picks up there will be a surge in imports, with foreign goods bought by UK manufacturers
(eg raw materials) and consumers.

(ii)

For example, in the UK, the high rate of imports creates a deficit in the balance of
payments, which in turn will weaken sterling and raise the cost of imports, thus giving
some impetus to price rises.

(iii)

To maintain the value of a country's currency, interest rates might need to be kept high,
and high interest rates appear to deter companies from investing.

In practice, achieving the best mix of economic policies also involves a number of problems, such as the
following:

2 Fiscal policy
FAST FORWARD

Fiscal policy seeks to influence the economy by managing the amounts which the government spends
and the amounts it collects through taxation. Fiscal policy can be used as an instrument of demand
management.

2.1 Fiscal policy and demand management
Key term

9/16

Fiscal policy is action by the government to spend money, or to collect money in taxes, with the purpose
of influencing the condition of the national economy.
A government might intervene in the economy by:
(a)

Spending more money and financing this expenditure by borrowing

(b)

Collecting more in taxes without increasing public spending

(c)

Collecting more in taxes in order to increase public spending, thus diverting income from one
part of the economy to another

Government spending is an 'injection' into the economy, adding to total demand for goods and services in
the economy (known as aggregate demand) and therefore national income, whereas taxes are a
'withdrawal' from the economy. Fiscal policy can thus be used as an instrument of demand management
ie deliberate policies to stimulate and control the level of aggregate demand in an economy. Too little
demand creates unemployment, too much creates inflation.
Fiscal policy appears to offer a method of managing aggregate demand in the economy.
(a)

If the government spends more – for example, on public works such as hospitals, roads and
sewers – without raising more money in taxation (ie by borrowing more) it will increase
expenditure in the economy, and so raise demand.

(b)

If the government kept its own spending at the same level but reduced the levels of taxation, it
would also stimulate demand in the economy because firms and households would have more of
their own money after tax for consumption or saving/investing. This is an expansionary policy.

(c)

In the same way, a government can reduce demand in the economy by raising taxes or reducing
its expenditure. This is a contractionary policy.

2.2 Fiscal policy and business
Fiscal policy affects business enterprises in both service and manufacturing industries in various ways.
For example:
(a)

By influencing the level of aggregate demand (AD) for goods and services in the economy,
macroeconomic policy affects the environment for business. Business planning should take
account of the likely effect of changes in AD for sales growth. For example, a drop in AD might
mean lower demand from customers for a business's products and services. Business planning
will be easier if government policy is relatively stable.

(b)

Tax changes brought about by fiscal policy affect businesses. For example, labour costs will be
affected by changes in employment taxes. For example, if indirect taxes such as sales tax or excise
duty rise, either the additional cost will have to be absorbed or the rise will have to be passed on to
consumers in the form of higher prices.

3 Monetary policy
FAST FORWARD

Monetary policy aims to influence monetary variables such as the rate of interest and the money supply in
order to achieve targets set, such as targets for the rate of inflation.
Money is important because:
(a)

It 'oils the wheels' of economic activity, providing an easy method for exchanging goods and
services (ie buying and selling).

(b)

The total amount of money in a national economy may have a significant influence on economic
activity and inflation.

3.1 The role and aims of monetary policy
Key term

9/16

Monetary policy is the regulation of the economy through control of the monetary system by operating on
such variables as the money supply, the level of interest rates and the conditions for availability of credit.
The effectiveness of monetary policy will depend on:
(a)

Whether the targets of monetary policy are achieved successfully

(b)

Whether the success of monetary policy leads on to the successful achievement of the
intermediate target (eg lower inflation)

(c)

Whether the successful achievement of the intermediate target (eg lower inflation) leads on to
the successful achievement of the overall objective (eg stronger economic growth)

3.2 Targets of monetary policy
Targets of monetary policy are likely to relate to the volume of national income and expenditure.


Growth in the size of the money supply



The level of interest rates



The volume of credit, or growth in the volume of credit



The volume of expenditure in the economy (ie national income or gross national product (GNP)
itself)

3.3 The money supply as a target of monetary policy
To monetarist economists, the money supply is a possible intermediate target of economic policy. This is
because they claim that an increase in the money supply will raise prices and money incomes, and this in
turn will raise the demand for money to spend.

3.4 Interest rates as a target for monetary policy
The authorities may decide that interest rates themselves should be a target of monetary policy. This
would be appropriate if it is considered that there is a direct relationship between interest rates and the
level of expenditure in the economy.
It certainly seems logical that interest rates should have a strong influence on economic activity.
However, although empirical evidence suggests there is some connection between interest rates and
investment (by companies) and consumer expenditure, the connection is not a stable and predictable one.
Some economists argue that the key element affecting investment is business confidence rather than the
level of interest rates. Interest rate changes are only likely to affect the level of expenditure after a
considerable time lag.
In 1997 the British government gave responsibility for setting short-term interest rates to the central bank,
the Bank of England. The Bank sets rates at a level which it considers appropriate, given the inflation rate
target set by the government. For example, if inflation is forecast to be excessive, increasing interest rates
42

Part
B Financial management environment
w


should increase saving, reduce borrowing and reduce investment, thus reducing aggregate demand in the
economy. With lower aggregate demand, there is less pressure for suppliers to increase prices as they
struggle to hit sales targets, so inflationary pressure is reduced. The purpose of having the central bank
setting interest rates is to remove the risk of political influence over the decisions. In the European
Monetary Union (where the euro is the common currency), the interest rates that prevail are effectively set
at the European level.

3.5 Interest rate policy and business
Interest rate changes brought about by government policy affect the borrowing costs of business.
Increases in interest rates will mean that fewer investments show positive returns, deterring companies
from borrowing to finance expansion. Increases in interest rates will also exert a downward pressure on
share prices, making it more difficult for companies to raise monies from new share issues. Businesses
will also be squeezed by decreases in consumer demand that result from increases in interest rates.

Question

Interest rate levels

Outline the effects on the economy of a policy of high interest rates to dampen demand and inflation.

Answer
An increase in interest rates is thought to reduce the money supply through demand for credit in the
economy, thereby reducing the level of effective demand. This will, in turn, decrease inflation and improve
the balance of payments (the latter by lowering the price of exports, increasing demand for them and
simultaneously increasing the relative price of imports, reducing demand for them, and freeing more
domestic output for sale abroad). Aggregate expenditure in the economy will decrease for various
reasons.
(a)

A higher interest rate encourages savings at the expense of consumer expenditure.

(b)

Higher interest rates will increase mortgage payments and will thus reduce the amount of
disposable income in the hands of home buyers for discretionary spending.

(c)

The higher cost of consumer credit will deter borrowing and spending on consumer durables.

(d)

Higher prices of goods due to higher borrowing costs for industry will also reduce some
consumer expenditure in the economy.

Investment expenditure may also decline for two reasons:
(a)

Higher interest rates deter some investment due to increased borrowing costs.

(b)

Higher interest rates may make the corporate sector pessimistic about future business prospects
and the economy. This may further reduce investment in the economy.

To the extent that higher domestic interest rates lead to an appreciation of the exchange rate, this should
reduce inflation by lowering the cost of imported items. Exporters will experience pressure on their costs
as a result of the more competitive price conditions they face, and may be less willing to concede high
wage demands, thus wage inflation may be constrained. The desired outcomes of the authorities' interest
rate policy noted above may be negated by the following effects of higher interest rates.
(a)

Higher interest results in greater interest income for savers, who may increase their spending due
to this interest windfall.

(b)

Since mortgage payments are generally a significant part of domestic household expenditure, any
increase in them will be reflected immediately in reported inflation. This could lead to higher wage
demands in the economy, and may result in a wage-price spiral.

(c)

By encouraging capital inflows, higher interest rates will tend to lead to an appreciation of the
currency's exchange rate. This makes exports more expensive and imports less expensive.

Part B Financial management
management environment
w

2: The economic environment for business

43

(d)

(e)

A reduction in investment may decrease the pressure of demand in the economy but at the same
time will set in motion a process which in the future could reduce the economy's potential for
production.
To the extent that higher interest rates squeeze demand in the economy, they will reduce
employment, decreasing the proceeds of taxation and increasing government expenditure on the
unemployed.

Case Study
Lift off! For the first time in ten years the US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates.
As expected rates were increased by 0.25% to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%.
A rate rise can be seen as a vote of confidence by the Federal Reserve in the US economy.
US unemployment has fallen to 5% – the lowest level in seven and a half years and the annual growth
rate is running at a robust 2.1%. But despite those healthy indicators, interest rates are at emergency
levels. Between September 2007 and December 2008 the benchmark Federal Funds rates fell from
5.25% to between zero and 0.25% in an effort to stave off recession.
Economists argue it is high time rates started to head higher, to prevent excessive consumer borrowing
and prevent bubbles emerging in the housing market and other types of assets.
There is some concern over companies that have borrowed too.
(Morris, 2015)

4 Exchange rates
FAST FORWARD

Exchange rates are determined by supply and demand, even under fixed exchange rate systems.
Governments can intervene to influence the exchange rate by, for example, adjusting interest rates.
Government policies on exchange rates might be fixed or floating exchange rates as two extreme
policies, but 'in-between' schemes have been more common.

Key term

An exchange rate is the rate at which one country's currency can be traded in exchange for another
country's currency.
Dealers in foreign exchange make their profit by buying currency at one exchange rate, and selling it at a
different rate. This means that there is a selling rate and a buying rate for a currency.

4.1 Factors influencing the exchange rate for a currency

12/16

The exchange rate between two currencies is determined primarily by supply and demand in the foreign
exchange markets. Demand comes from individuals, firms and governments who want to buy a currency
and supply comes from those who want to sell it.
Supply and demand in turn are subject to a number of influences.

Other factors influence the exchange rate through their relationship with the items identified above.
(a)

Total income and expenditure (demand) in the domestic economy determines the demand for
goods. This includes imported goods and demand for goods produced in the country which would
otherwise be exported if demand for them did not exist in the home markets.

(b)

Output capacity and the level of employment in the domestic economy might influence the
balance of payments because, if the domestic economy has full employment already, it will be
unable to increase its volume of production for exports.

(c)

The growth in the money supply influences interest rates and domestic inflation.

We will look at the cause of exchange rate fluctuations in more detail in Chapter 19.

4.2 Consequences of an exchange rate policy
Reasons for a policy of controlling the exchange rate are as follows.
(a)

To rectify a balance of trade deficit, by trying to bring about a fall in the exchange rate

(b)

To prevent a balance of trade surplus from getting too large, by trying to bring about a limited rise
in the exchange rate

(c)

To stabilise the exchange rate of the currency, as exporters and importers will then face less risk
of exchange rate movements wiping out their profits; a stable currency increases confidence in the
currency and promotes international trade.

4.3 Fixed exchange rates
A government may try to keep the exchange rate at a fixed level against a major currency such as the US
dollar, or may try to keep it within a specified value range. However, if a government cannot control
inflation, the real value of its currency would not remain fixed. If one country's rate of inflation is higher
than others, its export prices will become uncompetitive in overseas markets and the country's trade
deficit will grow (or its trade surplus will diminish). Devaluation of the currency would be necessary for a
recovery. For example, a government may work to move the exchange rate from $2:£1 to $1:£1 so that
exports become less expensive.
If exchange rates are fixed, any changes in (real) interest rates in one country will create pressure for the
movement of capital into or out of the country. Capital movements would put pressure on the country's
exchange rate to change. It follows that if exchange rates are fixed and capital is allowed to move freely between
countries (ie there are no exchange controls) all countries must have consistent policies on interest rates.

4.4 Floating exchange rates
Key term

Floating exchange rates are exchange rates which are allowed to fluctuate according to demand and
supply conditions in the foreign exchange markets.
Floating exchange rates are at the opposite end of the spectrum to fixed rates. At this extreme, exchange
rates are completely left to the free play of demand and supply market forces, and there is no official
financing at all. The ruling exchange rate is, therefore, at equilibrium by definition.
In practice, many governments seek to combine the advantages of exchange rate stability with flexibility
and to avoid the disadvantages of both rigidly fixed exchange rates and free floating. Managed (or dirty)
floating refers to a system whereby exchange rates are allowed to float, but from time to time the
authorities will intervene in the foreign exchange market:



To use their official reserves of foreign currencies to buy their own domestic currency
To sell their domestic currency to buy more foreign currency for the official reserves

Buying and selling in this way would be intended to influence the exchange rate of the domestic currency.
Governments do not have official reserves large enough to dictate exchange rates to the market, and can
only try to 'influence' market rates with intervention.

Speculation in the capital markets often has a much bigger short-term impact than changes in
fundamental supply and demand.

4.5 European Economic and Monetary Union
There are three main aspects to the European Monetary Union.
(a)

A common currency (the euro)

(b)

A European Central Bank. The European Central Bank has several roles:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

(c)

Issuing the common currency
Conducting monetary policy on behalf of the central government authorities
Acting as lender of last resort to all European banks
Managing the exchange rate for the common currency

A centralised monetary policy applies across all the countries in the union. This involves the
surrender of control over aspects of economic policy and therefore surrender of some political
sovereignty by the government of each member state to the central government body of the union.

4.6 Exchange rates and business
A change in the exchange rate will affect the relative prices of domestic and foreign produced goods and
services.
A lower exchange rate

A higher exchange rate

Domestic goods are cheaper in foreign markets so
demand for exports increases.

Domestic goods are more expensive in foreign
markets so demand for exports falls.

Foreign goods are more expensive so demand for
imports falls.

Foreign goods are cheaper so demand for imports
rises.

Imported raw materials are more expensive so
costs of production rise.

Imported raw materials are cheaper so costs of
production fall.

Fluctuating exchange rates create uncertainties for businesses involved in international trade. A service
industry is less likely to be affected because it is less likely to be involved in substantial international trade.
International trading companies can do a number of things to reduce their risk of suffering losses on
foreign exchange transactions, including the following.
(a)

Many companies buy currencies 'forward' at a fixed and known price.

(b)

Dealing in a 'hard' currency may lessen the risks attached to volatile currencies.

(c)

Operations can be managed so that the proportion of sales in one currency are matched by an
equal proportion of purchases in that currency.

(d)

Invoicing can be in the domestic currency. This means that the customer bears all the foreign
exchange risk, however, and, in industries where customers have high bargaining power, this may
be an unacceptable arrangement. Furthermore, there is the risk that sales will be adversely affected
by high prices, reducing demand.

(e)

Activities can be outsourced to the local market. Many of the Japanese car firms which have
invested in the UK in recent years have made efforts to obtain many of their inputs, subject to
quality limits, from local suppliers. Promotional activities can also be sourced locally.

(f)

Firms can aim at segments in the market which are not particularly price sensitive. For example,
many German car marques such as Mercedes have been marketed in the US on the basis of quality
and exclusivity. This is a type of strategy based on differentiation focus.

Foreign currency risk will be covered in more detail in Chapter 19.

5 Competition policy
5.1 Regulation and market failure
FAST FORWARD

Key term

The government influences markets in various ways, one of which is through direct regulation (eg the
Competition and Markets Authority in the UK).
Market failure is said to occur when the market mechanism (the interaction of supply and demand to
result in a market clearing price and quantity supplied/demanded) fails to result in economic efficiency,
and therefore the outcome is sub-optimal.
An important role of the government is the regulation of private markets where these fail to bring about
an efficient use of resources. In response to the existence of market failure, and as an alternative to
taxation and public provision of production, the state often resorts to regulating economic activity in a
variety of ways. Of the various forms of market failure, the following are the cases where regulation of
markets can often be the most appropriate policy response.
(a)

Imperfect competition
Where one company's large share or complete domination of the market is leading to inefficiency
or excessive profits, the state may intervene, for example through controls on prices or profits, in
order to try to reduce the effects of this power.

(b)

Social costs
A possible means of dealing with the problem of social costs or externalities is via some form of
regulation. Regulations might include, for example, controls on emissions of pollutants, restrictions
on car use in urban areas, the banning of smoking in public buildings, or compulsory car insurance.

(c)

Imperfect information
Regulation is often the best form of government action whenever informational inadequacies are
undermining the efficient operation of private markets. This is particularly so when consumer
choice is being distorted.

(d)

Equity
The government may also resort to regulation to improve social justice.

5.2 Types of regulation
Regulation can be defined as any form of state interference with the operation of the free market. This
could involve regulating demand, supply, price, profit, quantity, quality, entry, exit, information,
technology, or any other aspect of production and consumption in the market.
In many markets the participants (especially the firms) may decide to maintain a system of voluntary
self-regulation, possibly in order to try to avert the imposition of government controls. Areas where
self-regulation often exists include the professions (eg the Law Society, the British Medical Association
and other professional bodies).

5.3 Monopolies and mergers
Key term

12/16

In a pure monopoly, there is only one firm in the market, the sole producer of a good, which has no
closely competing substitutes.
A monopoly situation can have some advantages.
(a)

In certain industries arguably only by achieving a monopoly will a company be able to benefit from
the kinds of economies of scale (benefits of conducting operations on a large scale) that can
minimise prices.

(b)

Establishing a monopoly may be the best way for a business to maximise its profits.

Part B Financial management
management environment
w

2: The economic environment for business

47

However, monopolies often have several adverse consequences.
(a)

Companies can impose higher prices on consumers.

(b)

The lack of incentive of competition may mean companies have no incentive to improve their
products or offer a wider range of products.

(c)

There is no pressure on the company to improve the efficiency of its use of resources.

In practice, government policy is concerned not just with situations where one firm has a 100% market
share but also with other situations where an organisation has a significant market share.
Government regulatory authorities (for example the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK) can also
be asked to investigate what could be called 'oligopoly situations' involving explicit or implicit collusion
between firms, who together control the market. The Authority must decide whether or not the monopoly
is acting 'against the public interest'. If so, this may result in a number of measures, including:





Price cuts
Price and profit controls
Removal of entry barriers
The breaking up of the firm (rarely)

Case Study
The healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson has become the latest foreign company to be accused of
misconduct in China.
A ruling by a Shanghai court ordered the US company to pay $85,000 (£56,000) to a local distributor for
violating anti-monopoly laws.
Two subsidiaries of the company were accused of setting a minimum price for the sale of surgical
instruments.
Multinationals have faced increased scrutiny from the Chinese authorities.
Last month, two foreign milk suppliers announced price cuts after the government launched an
investigation into possible price fixing.
(BBC, 2013)
A prospective merger between two or more companies may be referred to the regulatory authority. In the
UK, a referral may be made to the Competition and Markets Authority for investigation if a larger company
will gain more than 25% market share and where a merger appears likely to lead to a substantial lessening
of competition in one or more markets in the UK. Many other countries have similar regulatory authorities.
If a potential merger is investigated, the Authority again has to determine whether or not the merger would
be against the public interest. As with monopolies, it will assess the relative benefits and costs in order to
arrive at a decision.

Question

Competition

Look through newspapers or on the internet for a report on the activities of regulatory bodies such as the
Competition and Markets Authority. Why is the investigation being carried out and how was it initiated?

5.4 Restrictive practices
Some countries have legislation which deals with restrictive practices that distort, restrict or prevent
competition. A notable example of a restrictive practice would be agreements with direct competitors
resulting in them colluding to the disadvantage of the consumer (eg price-fixing agreements). The

48

Part
B Financial management environment
w


legislation may also deal with abuse of dominant position offences, such as predatory pricing (charging
low prices to unfairly destroy competition) or refusing to supply so as to restrict competition.

5.5 Deregulation
Deregulation or 'liberalisation' is, in general, the opposite of regulation. Deregulation can be defined as the
removal or weakening of any form of statutory (or voluntary) regulation of free market activity.
Deregulation allows free market forces more scope to determine the outcome.
Deregulation, whose main aim is to introduce more competition into an industry by removing statutory or
other entry barriers, has the following potential benefits.
(a)
(b)

Improved incentives for internal/cost efficiency
Greater competition compels managers to try harder to keep down costs.
Improved allocative efficiency
Competition keeps down prices closer to marginal cost, and firms therefore produce closer to the
socially optimal output level.

In some industries it could have certain disadvantages, including the following.
(a)

(b)

(c)

Loss of economies of scale
If increased competition means that each firm produces less output on a smaller scale, unit costs
will be higher.
Lower quality or quantity of service
The need to reduce costs may lead firms to reduce quality or eliminate unprofitable but socially
valuable services.
Need to protect competition
It may be necessary to implement a regulatory regime to protect competition where inherent forces
have a tendency to eliminate it, for example if there is a dominant firm already in the industry, as in
the case of British Telecom. In this type of situation, effective 'regulation for competition' will be
required, ie regulatory measures aimed at maintaining competitive pressures, whether existing or
potential.

5.6 Privatisation
FAST FORWARD

Privatisation is a policy of introducing private enterprise into industries which were previously state-owned
or state-operated.
Privatisation takes three broad forms.
(a)

(b)
(c)

The deregulation of industries, to allow private firms to compete against state-owned businesses
where they were not allowed to compete before (for example, deregulation of bus and coach
services; deregulation of postal services)
Contracting out work to private firms, where the work was previously done by government
employees – for example, refuse collection or hospital laundry work
Transferring the ownership of assets from the state to private shareholders

Privatisation can improve efficiency in one of two ways.
(a)
(b)

If the effect of privatisation is to increase competition, the effect might be to reduce or eliminate
allocative inefficiency.
The effect of denationalisation might be to make the industries more cost-conscious, because they
will be directly answerable to shareholders, and under scrutiny from stock market investors.

There are other possible advantages of privatisation.
(a)

It provides an immediate source of money for the government.

(b)

It reduces bureaucratic and political meddling in the industries concerned.

Part B Financial management
management environment
w

2: The economic environment for business

49

(c)

It encourages wider share ownership. Denationalisation is one method of creating wider share
ownership, as the sale of BT, British Gas and some other nationalised industries have shown in the
UK.

There are arguments against privatisation too.

Exam focus
point

(a)

State-owned industries are more likely to respond to the public interest, ahead of the profit motive.
For example, state-owned industries are more likely to cross-subsidise unprofitable operations
from profitable ones.

(b)

Encouraging private competition to state-run industries might be inadvisable where significant
economies of scale can be achieved by monopoly operations.

(c)

There is also an argument that privatised businesses try to use their market power to create
monopolies and to drive up prices.

In the exam, you will not be tested on the detail of country-specific 'competition policy' rules but you will
need to understand the general issues surrounding the regulation of companies with high levels of
monopoly power.

6 Government assistance for business
6.1 Official aid schemes
FAST FORWARD

The freedom of European governments to offer cash grants and other forms of direct assistance to
business is limited by European Union policies designed to prevent the distortion of free market
competition.
A government may provide finance to companies in cash grants and other forms of official direct
assistance, as part of its policy of helping to develop the national economy, especially in high technology
industries and in areas of high unemployment.
Government incentives might be offered on:
(a)

A regional basis, giving help to firms that invest in an economically depressed area of the country

(b)

A selective national basis, giving help to firms that invest in an industry that the government
would like to see developing more quickly, for example robotics or fibre optics

In Europe, such assistance is increasingly limited by European Union policies designed to prevent the
distortion of free market competition.

7 Green policies
FAST FORWARD

There are a number of policy approaches to pollution, such as polluter pays policies, subsidies and
direct legislation.
The environment is increasingly seen as an important issue facing managers in both the public and private
sectors. The problems of pollution and the environment appear to call for international co-operation
between governments. Pollutants expelled into the atmosphere in the UK are said to cause acid rain to fall
in Scandinavia, for example.

7.1 Pollution policy
Key term

50

12/16

Externalities are positive or negative effects on third parties resulting from production and consumption
activities.

2: The economic environment for business

Part
B Financial management environment
w


Pollution, for example from exhaust gas emissions or the dumping of waste, is often discussed in relation
to environmental policy. If polluters take little or no account of their actions on others, this generally
results in the output of polluting industries being greater than is optimal.
One solution is to levy a tax on polluters equal to the cost of removing the effect of the externality they
generate: the polluter pays principle. This will encourage firms to cut emissions and provides an incentive
for them to research ways of permanently reducing pollution.
Apart from the imposition of a tax, there are a number of other measures open to the government in
attempting to reduce pollution. One of the main measures available is the application of subsidies which
may be used either to persuade polluters to reduce output and hence pollution, or to assist with
expenditure on production processes, such as new machinery and air cleaning equipment, which reduce
levels of pollution.

7.2 Legislation
An alternative approach used in the UK is to impose legislation laying down regulations governing waste
disposal and atmospheric emissions. Waste may only be disposed of with prior consent and if none is
given, or it is exceeded, the polluter is fined. There may also be attempts with this type of approach to
specify standards of, for example, air and water quality with appropriate penalties for not conforming to
the required standards.

7.3 Advantages of 'environmentally friendly policies' for a business
There may be various reasons why a business may gain from adopting a policy of strict compliance with
environmental regulations, or of going further and taking voluntary initiatives to protect aspects of the
environment.
(a)

If potential customers perceive the business to be environmentally friendly, some may be more
inclined to buy its products.

(b)

A corporate image which embraces environmentally friendly policies may enhance relationships
with the public in general or with local communities.

(c)

People may prefer to work for an environmentally friendly business.

(d)

'Ethical' investment funds may be more likely to buy the firm's shares.

The case study below highlights the dangers for a company of not displaying environmentally friendly
policies.

Case Study
In September 2015, the world's largest car maker, Volkswagen, made headlines when it was discovered
that it had deceived US regulators in exhaust emissions tests. Devices were installed in test vehicles which
gave better emissions results than would be achieved when the vehicles were actually used on the road.
Volkswagen set aside €6.5bn to cover the costs of the scandal and the CEO resigned.

8 Corporate governance regulation
FAST FORWARD

Corporate governance impacts on the way companies make decisions, their financial organisation and
their relations with investors and auditors.
In Chapter 1, Section 5.2.1, we looked at how corporate governance is used to enforce the achievement of
stakeholder objectives. Corporate governance has emerged as a major issue in the last 20 years in the
light of several high profile collapses. Guidance has been given because of the lack of confidence
perceived in financial reporting and in the ability of auditors to provide the assurances required by the
users of financial accounts.

8.1 Impact of corporate governance requirements on businesses
The consequences of failure to obey corporate governance regulations should be considered along with
failure to obey any other sort of legislation.
Businesses that fail to comply with the law run the risk of financial penalties and the financial
consequences of accompanying bad publicity.
In regimes where corporate governance principles are guidelines rather than regulations, businesses will
consider what the consequences might be of non-compliance, in particular the impact on share prices.
Obedience to requirements or guidelines can also have consequences for businesses. Compliance may
involve extra costs, including extra procedures and investment necessary to conform; for example, the
creation of sufficiently independent board committees relating to remuneration, nomination and audit.

Policy targets – quantified levels or ranges which policy is intended to achieve
Policy instruments – the tools used to achieve objectives

Achievement of economic growth, low inflation, full employment and balance of payments stability are
