(b)

Investment in working capital arises from the need to pay out money for resources (such as raw
materials) before it can be recovered from sales of the finished product or service. The funds are
therefore only committed for a short period of time.

1.1.2 Investment by the commercial sector
Investment by commercial organisations might include investment in:





Plant and machinery
Research and development
Advertising
Warehouse facilities

The overriding feature of a commercial sector investment is that it is generally based on financial
considerations alone. The various capital expenditure appraisal techniques that we will be looking at
assess the financial aspects of capital investment.

1.1.3 Investment by not for profit organisations
Investment by not for profit organisations differs from investment by commercial organisations for several
reasons.
(a)

Relatively few not for profit organisations' capital investments are made with the intention of
earning a financial return.

(b)

When there are two or more ways of achieving the same objective (mutually exclusive investment
opportunities), a commercial organisation might prefer the option with the lowest present value of
cost.
Not for profit organisations, however, rather than just considering financial cost and financial
benefits, will often have regard to the social costs and social benefits of investments.

(c)

The cost of capital that is applied to project cash flows by the public sector will not be a
'commercial' rate of return, but one that is determined by the government. Any targets that a
public sector investment has to meet before being accepted will therefore not be based on the
same criteria as those in the commercial sector.

1.2 The capital budgeting process
Knowledge brought forward from earlier studies

You should be familiar with the capital budgeting process and the investment decision-making process.
This section is included for revision only.

1.2.1 Creation of capital budgets
The capital budget will normally be prepared to cover a longer period than sales, production and resource
budgets, say from three to five years, although it should be broken down into periods matching those of
other budgets.
It should indicate the expenditure required to cover capital projects already underway and those it is
anticipated will start in the three- to five-year period (say) of the capital budget.
The budget should therefore be based on the current production budget, future expected levels of
production and the long-term development of the organisation, and industry, as a whole.
Budget limits or constraints might be imposed internally or externally.
(a)

The imposition of internal constraints, which are often imposed when managerial resources are
limited, is known as soft capital rationing.

Part D Investment appraisal
w

7: Investment decisions

147

(b)

Hard capital rationing occurs when external limits are set, perhaps because of scarcity of
financing, high financing costs or restrictions on the amount of external financing an organisation
can seek.

Projects can arise from top management policy decisions or from sources such as mandatory government
regulations (health, safety and welfare capital expenditure), or be appraised using the techniques covered in
this chapter and the next.
Overall responsibility for authorisation and monitoring of capital expenditure is, in most large
organisations, the responsibility of a committee. For example:




Expenditure up to $75,000 may be approved by individual divisional managers.
Expenditure between $75,000 and $150,000 may be approved by divisional management.
Expenditure over $150,000 may be approved by the board of directors.

1.2.2 The investment decision-making process
A typical model for investment decision-making has a number of distinct stages.





Origination of proposals
Project screening
Analysis and acceptance
Monitoring and review

1.2.3 Origination of proposals
Ideas for investment might come from those working in technical positions. A factory manager, for
example, could be well placed to identify ways in which expanded capacity or new machinery could
increase output or the efficiency of the manufacturing process.
Innovative ideas, such as new product lines, are more likely to come from those in higher levels of
management, given their strategic view of the organisation's direction and their knowledge of the
competitive environment.
The overriding feature of any proposal is that it should be consistent with the organisation's overall
strategy to achieve its objectives.

1.2.4 Project screening
Each proposal must be subject to detailed screening. So that a qualitative evaluation of a proposal can be
made, a number of key questions such as those below might be asked before any financial analysis is
undertaken. Only if the project passes this initial screening will more detailed financial analysis begin.









What is the purpose of the project?
Does it 'fit' with the organisation's long-term objectives?
Is it a mandatory investment, for example to conform with safety legislation?
What resources are required and are they available, eg money, capacity, labour?
Do we have the necessary management expertise to guide the project to completion?
Does the project expose the organisation to unnecessary risk?
How long will the project last and what factors are key to its success?
Have all possible alternatives been considered?

1.2.5 Analysis and acceptance
The analysis stage can be broken down into a number of steps.

148

Step 1

Complete and submit standard format financial information as a formal investment
proposal.

Step 2

Classify the project by type (to separate projects into those that require more or less
rigorous financial appraisal, and those that must achieve a greater or lesser rate of return in
order to be deemed acceptable).

7: Investment decisions

Part D Investment appraisal
w



Step 3
Step 4
Step 5

Carry out financial analysis of the project.

Step 6

Make the decision (go/no go).

Step 7

Monitor the progress of the project.

Compare the outcome of the financial analysis to predetermined acceptance criteria.
Consider the project in the light of the capital budget for the current and future operating
periods.

Financial analysis
The financial analysis will involve the application of the organisation's preferred investment appraisal
techniques.
Here are examples of the type of question that will be addressed at this stage.





What cash flows/profits will arise from the project and when?
Has inflation been considered in the determination of the cash flows?
What are the results of the financial appraisal?
Has any allowance been made for risk and, if so, what was the outcome?

Some types of project, for example a marketing investment decision, may give rise to cash inflows and
returns which are so intangible and difficult to quantify that a full financial appraisal may not be
possible. In this case, more weight may be given to a consideration of the qualitative issues.

Qualitative issues
Besides reviewing the project's 'fit' with the organisation's overall objectives and whether it is a mandatory
investment, there is a very wide range of other qualitative issues that may be relevant to a particular
project.
(a)

What are the implications of not undertaking the investment, eg adverse effect on staff morale, loss
of market share?

(b)

Will acceptance of this project lead to the need for further investment activity in the future?

(c)

What will be the effect on the company's image?

(d)

Will the organisation be more flexible as a result of the investment, and better able to respond to
market and technology changes?

Go/no go decision
Go/no go decisions on projects may be made at different levels within the organisational hierarchy,
depending on three factors.




The type of investment
Its perceived riskiness
The amount of expenditure required

For example, a divisional manager may be authorised to make decisions up to $25,000, an area manager
up to $150,000 and a group manager up to $300,000, with board approval for greater amounts.
Once the go/no go (or accept/reject) decision has been made, the organisation is committed to the
project, and the decision-maker must accept that the project's success or failure reflects on their ability to
make sound decisions.

1.2.6 Monitoring the progress of the project
During the project's progress, project controls should be applied to ensure the following.




Capital spending does not exceed the amount authorised.
The implementation of the project is not delayed.
The anticipated benefits are eventually obtained.

2 Relevant cash flows
FAST FORWARD

Relevant costs of investment appraisal include opportunity costs, working capital costs and wider costs
such as infrastructure and human development costs. Non-relevant costs include past costs and
committed costs.

2.1 Relevant cash flows in investment appraisals
The cash flows that should be considered in investment appraisals are those which arise as a
consequence of the investment decision under evaluation. This means that cash flows are only relevant if
they are future incremental cash flows.
Any costs incurred in the past, or any committed costs which will be incurred regardless of whether or
not an investment is undertaken, are not relevant cash flows. They have occurred, or will occur, whatever
investment decision is taken. For example, if a company has spent money on market research into the
potential returns from an investment, the cost is a sunk cost and should not be taken into consideration
when deciding about the future and whether or not the investment should go ahead.
Any costs which do not represent an actual cash flow should also be ignored.
Here are some examples of non-relevant costs.




Exam focus
point

Centrally allocated overheads that are not a consequence of undertaking the project
Management costs and marketing research expenditure already incurred
Depreciation

The ACCA examining team comments that students often include non-relevant costs in investment
appraisals. Make sure you identify any non-relevant costs when answering questions in the exam.
The annual cash profits from a project can be calculated as the incremental contribution earned minus
any incremental fixed costs which are additional cash items of expenditure (that is, ignoring depreciation
and so on).
There are, however, other cash flows to consider. These might include the following.

2.1.1 Opportunity costs
These are the costs incurred or revenues lost from diverting existing resources from their best use.

2.1.2 Example: Opportunity costs
If a salesman, who is paid an annual salary of $30,000, is diverted to work on a new project and as a result
existing sales of $50,000 are lost, the opportunity cost to the new project will be the $50,000 of lost sales.
The salesman's salary of $30,000 is not an opportunity cost since it will be incurred however their time is
spent.

2.1.3 Tax
This refers to the extra tax that will be payable on extra profits, or the reductions in tax arising from tax
allowable depreciation or operating losses in any year. We shall consider the effect of taxation in Chapter 9.

2.1.4 Residual value
This refers to the residual value or disposal value of equipment at the end of its life, or its disposal cost.

2.1.5 Working capital
If a company invests $20,000 in working capital and earns cash profits of $50,000, the net cash receipts
will be $30,000. This is because an increase in working capital reduces the net cash inflows below the
amount that could be expected from the 'cash profits' for the period.
Working capital will be released again at the end of a project's life, and so there will be a cash inflow
arising out of the eventual realisation into cash of the project's inventory and receivables in the final year
of the project. In other words, a reduction in working capital is included in a cash flow forecast as an
increase in cash.
Cash flow from profits in the period
Minus working capital increase
or Plus working capital reduction
Equals adjusted cash flow for the period

$
X
(X)
X
X

In investment appraisal, an investment in working capital at the beginning of the investment period is
treated as an outflow of cash, and a reduction in working capital to $0 at the end of the investment period
is treated as an inflow of cash.

2.2 Other relevant costs
Costs that will often need to be considered include:


Infrastructure costs such as additional information technology or communication systems



Marketing costs may be substantial, particularly of course if the investment is in a new product or
service. They will include the costs of market research, promotion and branding and the
organisation of new distribution channels.



Human resource costs including training costs and the costs of reorganisation arising from
investments



Additional specific fixed costs may need to be considered, while apportioned existing general
overheads are ignored. Specific fixed costs include additional electricity costs incurred by the use
of new machines.

2.3 Timing of cash flows
It is normally assumed that cash flows that arise evenly over a period of time arise at the end of that
period. For example, revenues earned in Year 1 are assumed to occur at the end of Year 1.
An exception to this general rule is that cash flows occurring at the beginning of a year (or time period)
are assumed to occur at the end of the previous time period. So cash flows at the beginning of Year 1, for
example, are assumed to occur at the end of Year 0 (which is 'now').

2.4 Relevant benefits of investments
FAST FORWARD

Relevant benefits from investments include not only increased cash flows but also savings and better
relationships with customers and employees.

2.4.1 Types of benefit
The benefits from a proposed investment must also be evaluated. These might consist of benefits of
several types.
(a)

Savings because assets used currently will no longer be used. The savings should include:
(i)
(ii)

Savings in staff costs
Savings in other operating costs, such as consumable materials

Part D Investment appraisal
w

7: Investment decisions

151

(b)

Extra savings or revenue benefits because of the improvements or enhancements that the
investment might bring:
More sales revenue and so additional contribution
More efficient system operation
Further savings in staff time, resulting perhaps in reduced future staff growth

(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(c)

Possibly, some one-off revenue benefits from the sale of assets that are currently in use, but
which will no longer be required

Some benefits might be intangible, or impossible to give a monetary value to.
(a)

Greater customer satisfaction, arising from a more prompt service (eg because of a computerised
sales and delivery service)

(b)

Improved staff morale from working with higher-quality assets

(c)

Better decision-making may result from better information systems

Qualitative factors may influence a decision, but cannot easily be brought into the financial analysis of a
proposed investment.

2.5 Example: Relevant cash flows
Elsie is considering the manufacture of a new product which would involve the use of both a new machine
(costing $150,000) and an existing machine, which cost $80,000 two years ago and has a current net
book value of $60,000. There is sufficient capacity on this machine, which has so far been underutilised.
Annual sales of the product would be 5,000 units, selling at $32 per unit. Unit costs would be as follows.
Direct labour (4 hours at $2 per hour)
Direct materials
Fixed costs including depreciation

$
8
7
9
24

The project would have a five-year life, after which the new machine would have a net residual value of
$10,000. Because direct labour is continually in short supply, labour resources would have to be diverted
from other work which currently earns a contribution of $1.50 per direct labour hour. The fixed overhead
absorption rate would be $2.25 per hour ($9 per unit) but actual expenditure on fixed overhead would not
alter.
Working capital requirements would be $10,000 in the first year, rising to $15,000 in the second year and
remaining at this level until the end of the project, when it will all be recovered. The company's cost of
capital is 20%. Ignore taxation.
You are required to identify the relevant cash flows for the decision as to whether or not the project is
worthwhile.

Solution
The timing of the investment in working capital should usually be attributed to the time period when the
increase occurs. With an investment, the build-up of working capital is more likely to occur at the
beginning of the period rather than gradually throughout the period. It is usually therefore normal
convention to allocate changes in working capital to the beginning of the year rather than the end of the
year. This means that the investment in working capital in the first year happens near the beginning of the
first year (= Year 0) and the further increase in the second year happens at the beginning of Year 2
(= Year 1).
The relevant cash flows are as follows.

(a)

When the working capital tied up in the project is 'recovered' at the end of the project, it will
provide an extra cash inflow (for example debtors will eventually pay up).
(f)

All other costs, which are past costs, notional accounting costs or costs which would be incurred
anyway without the project, are not relevant to the investment decision.

3 Payback period
FAST FORWARD

9/16

The payback method of investment appraisal and the ROCE/ARR/ROI methods of investment appraisal are
popular appraisal techniques despite their limitations (of which you should be aware).
Payback is the amount of time it takes for cash inflows = cash outflows.
There are a number of ways of evaluating capital projects, two of which we will be examining in this
chapter. We will look first at the payback method.

Exam focus
point

Key term

Exam questions often ask about the pros and cons of the payback method. The ACCA examining team has
commented that discussion questions covering payback and ROCE are often poorly attempted by
students.
Payback is the time it takes the cash inflows from a capital investment project to equal the cash outflows,
usually expressed in years. It is the length of time before the cash inflows from an investment pay back
the investment outlay.
Payback is often used as a 'first screening method' in investment appraisal. By this, we mean that when a
capital investment project is being considered, the first question to ask is: 'How long will it take to pay
back its cost?' The organisation might have a target payback, and so it would reject a capital project
unless its payback period were less than a certain number of years.
However, a project should not be evaluated on the basis of payback alone. If a project gets through the
payback test, it ought then to be evaluated with a more sophisticated investment appraisal technique that
takes into consideration the total return over the full investment period.

3.1 Why is payback alone an inadequate investment appraisal
technique?
The reason why payback should not be used on its own to evaluate capital investments should seem fairly
obvious if you look at the figures below for two mutually exclusive projects (this means that only one of
them can be undertaken).

7: Investment decisions

153

Project P pays back in year 3 (about one quarter of the way through year 3). Project Q pays back halfway
through year 2. Using payback alone to judge capital investments, project Q would be preferred.
However, the returns from project P over its life are much higher than the returns from project Q. Project
P will earn total profits before depreciation of $140,000 on an investment of $60,000. Project Q will earn
total profits before depreciation of only $25,000 on an investment of $60,000.

3.2 Disadvantages of the payback method
There are a number of serious drawbacks to the payback method.
(a)

It ignores the timing of cash flows within the payback period.

(b)

It ignores the cash flows after the end of the payback period and therefore the total project return.

(c)

It ignores the time value of money (a concept incorporated into more sophisticated appraisal
methods). This means that it does not take account of the fact that $1 today is worth more than $1
in one year's time. An investor who has $1 today can either consume it immediately or alternatively
can invest it at the prevailing interest rate, say 10%, to get a return of $1.10 in a year's time.

(d)

Payback is unable to distinguish between projects with the same payback period.

(e)

The choice of any cut-off payback period by an organisation is arbitrary.

(f)

It may lead to excessive investment in short-term projects.

(g)

It takes account of the risk of the timing of cash flows but not the variability of those cash flows.

3.3 Advantages of the payback method
In spite of its limitations, the payback method continues to be popular, and the following points can be
made in its favour.
(a)

It is simple to calculate and simple to understand. This may be important when management
resources are limited. It is similarly helpful in communicating information about minimum
requirements to managers responsible for submitting projects.

(b)

It uses cash flows rather than accounting profits.

(c)

It can be used as a screening device as a first stage in eliminating obviously inappropriate projects
prior to more detailed evaluation.

(d)

The fact that it tends to bias in favour of short-term projects means that it tends to minimise both
financial and business risk.

(e)

It can be used when there is a capital rationing situation to identify those projects which generate
additional cash for investment quickly.

4 Return on capital employed

Estimated average/total profits
100%
Estimated average/initial investment

The return on capital employed method (ROCE) (also called the accounting rate of return method or the
return on investment (ROI) method) of appraising a capital project is to estimate the accounting rate of
return that the project should yield. If it exceeds a target rate of return, the project will be undertaken. In
Chapter 1 we discussed how return on capital employed is measured for financial accounting purposes.
Here the measure is calculated in relation to investments.
Unfortunately, there are several different definitions of 'return on capital employed'. One of the most
popular is as follows.

154

ROCE =

The others include:

ROCE =

There are arguments in favour of each of these definitions. The most important point is, however, that the
method selected should be used consistently. For examination purposes we recommend the first definition
unless the question clearly indicates that some other one is to be used.

Exam focus
point

Previous exams have stated that the ROCE calculation should be based on the average investment and
used the first definition.

4.1 Example: Return on capital employed
A company has a target return on capital employed of 20% for its capital investments (using the first
definition from the paragraph above), and is now considering the following project.

The capital asset would be depreciated by 25% of its cost each year, and will have no residual value. You
are required to assess whether the project should be undertaken.

As the table shows, the ROCE is low in the early stages of the project, partly because of low profits in Year
1 but mainly because the net book value of the asset is much higher early on in its life.
The project does not achieve the target ROCE of 20% in its first two years, but exceeds it in years 3 and 4.
So should it be undertaken?
When the ROCE from a project varies from year to year, it makes sense to take an overall or 'average' view
of the project's return. In this case, we should look at the return as a whole over the four-year period.

4.2 ROCE and the comparison of mutually exclusive projects
The ROCE method of capital investment appraisal can also be used to compare two or more projects
which are mutually exclusive. The project with the highest ROCE would be selected (provided that the
expected ROCE is higher than the company's target ROCE).

4.3 Example: ROCE and mutually exclusive projects
Arrow wants to buy a new item of equipment which will be used to provide a service to customers of the
company. Two models of equipment are available, one with a slightly higher capacity and greater reliability
than the other. The expected costs and profits of each item are as follows.

ROCE is measured as the average annual profit after depreciation, divided by the average net book value of
the asset. You are required to decide which item of equipment should be selected, if any, if the company's
target ROCE is 30%.

Both projects would earn a return in excess of 30%, but since item X would earn a bigger ROCE, it would
be preferred to item Y, even though the profits from Y would be higher by an average of $10,000 a year.

4.4 The drawbacks to the ROCE method of capital investment appraisal
The ROCE method of capital investment appraisal has the serious drawback that it does not take account
of the timing of the profits from an investment. Whenever capital is invested in a project, money is tied up
until the project begins to earn profits which pay back the investment. Money tied up in one project cannot
be invested anywhere else until the profits come in. Management should be aware of the benefits of early
repayments from an investment, which will provide the money for other investments.
There are a number of other disadvantages.
(a)

It is based on accounting profits and not cash flows. Accounting profits are subject to a number of
different accounting treatments.

(b)

It is a relative measure rather than an absolute measure and therefore takes no account of the size
of the investment.

(c)

It takes no account of the length of the project.

(d)

Like the payback method, it ignores the time value of money.

There are, however, advantages to the ROCE method.
(a)

It is a quick and simple calculation.

(b)

It involves the familiar concept of a percentage return. The fact that it gives a relative measure
means that ROCE makes it easy to compare two investment options.

(c)

It looks at the entire project life.

Introduction
The payback and ROCE methods of investment appraisal were considered in
the previous chapter. This chapter will look at discounted cash flow (DCF)
methods of investment appraisal which take into account changes in the value
of money over time. These two methods, Net Present Value (NPV) and
Internal Rate of Return (IRR), use the technique of discounting to bring all
cash flows resulting from the investment to a present day value by eliminating
the interest that would have been earned on that cash flow had it happened
now rather than later.
The interest rate (referred to as discount rate in this context) used in this
calculation is specific to each organisation, and depends on the relative levels
of debt and equity funding of the organisation. This links to later studies in this
text concerning cost of capital and capital structure.
Chapter 9 will look at how inflation and taxation can be incorporated into
appraisal techniques.

You may be asked to discuss the relative merits of the various investment appraisal techniques as well as
to demonstrate your ability to apply the techniques themselves.
Performance objective 9 requires you to 'value projects, financial securities and instruments and advise on
their costs and benefits to the organisation'. This chapter concentrates on valuing projects using
discounted cash flow techniques.

1 Discounted cash flow (Brought forward knowledge)
Knowledge brought forward from earlier studies

You should be familiar with the concepts of interest and discounting from your earlier studies. This
section is included for revision purposes only.
There are two methods of using DCF to evaluate capital investments, the NPV method and the IRR
method.

Discounted cash flow, or DCF for short, is an investment appraisal technique which takes into account
both the timings of cash flows and also total profitability over a project's life.
Three important points about DCF are as follows.

162

(a)

DCF looks at the cash flows of a project, not the accounting profits. Cash flows are considered
because they show the costs and benefits of a project when they actually occur and ignore notional
costs such as depreciation.

(b)

Only future incremental cash inflows and outflows are considered. This means that costs incurred
in the past (sunk costs) should be ignored. Costs which would need to be incurred regardless of
whether or not the project is undertaken should also be ignored.

(c)

The timing of cash flows is taken into account by discounting them. $1 earned today will be worth
more than $1 earned after two years. This is partly due to the effect of inflation, and partly due to
the greater certainty in having $1 in hand today compared with the promise of $1 in a year's time.
In addition, cash we have in hand today can be spent or invested elsewhere: for example, put into a
savings account to earn annual interest.

1.1 Compounding
Suppose that a company has $10,000 to invest, and wants to earn a return of 10% (compound interest)
on its investments. This means that if the $10,000 could be invested at 10%, the value of the investment
with interest would build up as follows.
(a)
(b)
(c)

After 1 year $10,000
After 2 years $10,000
After 3 years $10,000

(1.10) = $11,000
2
(1.10) = $12,100
3
(1.10) = $13,310 and so on.

This is compounding. Compounding tells us how much an investment will be worth at the end, and can be
used to compare two projects with the same duration. The formula for the future value of an investment
plus accumulated interest after n time periods is:
FV = PV (1 + r)

n

Where FV is the future value of the investment with interest
PV is the initial or 'present' value of the investment
r is the compound rate of return per time period, expressed as a proportion
(so 10% = 0.10, 5% = 0.05, and so on)
n is the number of time periods

1.2 Discounting
Key term

Present value is the cash equivalent now of a sum of money receivable or payable at a stated future date,
discounted at a specified rate of return.
Discounting starts with the future value, and converts a future value to a present value. Discounting tells
us how much an investment will be worth in today's terms. This method can be used to compare two
investments with different durations.
For example, if a company expects to earn a (compound) rate of return of 10% on its investments, how
much would it need to invest now to have the following investments?
(a)
(b)
(c)

$11,000 after 1 year
$12,100 after 2 years
$13,310 after 3 years

The answer is $10,000 in each case, and we can calculate it by discounting. The discounting formula to
calculate the present value of a future sum of money at the end of n time periods is:

Discounting can be applied to both money receivable and also to money payable at a future date. By
discounting all payments and receipts from a capital investment to a present value, they can be compared
on a common basis at a value which takes account of when the various cash flows will take place.

Question

Present value

Spender expects the cash inflow from an investment to be $40,000 after two years and another $30,000
after three years. Its target rate of return is 12%. Calculate the present value of these future returns, and
explain what this present value signifies.

The present value of the future returns, discounted at 12%, is $53,240. This means that if Spender
can invest now to earn a return of 12% on its investments, it would have to invest $53,240 now to
earn $40,000 after two years plus $30,000 after three years.

1.3 The discount factor
In the compounding and discounting examples above, we used the company's required rate of return as
the discount factor. How do companies decide the rate of return that they require?
Imagine Company A has a bank account, earning 5% interest. When considering whether or not to invest
in a project, the company's directors may use the bank interest rate as a benchmark. If the investment's
rate of return is 3%, would Company A invest? Probably not, because a higher level of return can be
earned by simply depositing the same amount of money in the bank account. However, if the investment's
rate of return is 8%, then the company will probably choose to invest.
On the other hand, consider Company B, which has no cash in hand. It will be required to borrow from a
bank should it decide to invest in a project. Company B's directors may use the loan interest as a
benchmark when evaluating investments to ensure that they only accept projects which sufficiently reward
the company for the additional costs the company has to bear in making the investment. If the company
borrows at 6%, it will most likely reject a project which yields a rate of return of 3%. However, it may
consider a project that is expected to yield a rate of return of 8%.
These examples are two simplistic ways of thinking about the cost of capital, often used to derive a
discount rate for DCF analysis and investment appraisal.
The cost of capital has two aspects to it.
(a)
(b)

It is the cost of funds that a company raises and uses.
The return that investors expect to be paid for putting funds into the company. It is therefore the
minimum return that a company should make from its own investments, to earn the cash flows
out of which investors can be paid their return.

The cost of capital is not the cost of borrowing, although the cost of borrowing may be an element in the
cost of capital. We will study the cost of capital in detail in Part E of this Study Text. For the purpose of
this chapter, we shall assume that the cost of capital is a known required percentage annual rate of return
on investments.

2 The net present value method
12/14, 6/15, Sep/Dec15, Mar/Jun 16, 9/16, Mar/Jun 17
FAST FORWARD

The NPV method of investment appraisal is to invest in projects with a positive NPV.
An annuity is a constant cash flow for a number of years. A perpetuity is a constant annual cash flow (an
annuity) that will last forever.

Key terms

Net present value or NPV is the value obtained by discounting all cash outflows and inflows of a capital
investment project by a chosen target rate of return or cost of capital.

The NPV method compares the present value (PV) of all the cash inflows from an investment with the
present value of all the cash outflows from an investment. The NPV is thus calculated as the PV of cash
inflows minus the PV of cash outflows.
NPV

NPV positive

Return from investment's cash inflows in excess of cost of capital

NPV negative

Return from investment's cash inflows below cost of capital

NPV 0

Return from investment's cash inflows same as cost of capital

undertake project

don't undertake project

Note. We assume that the cost of capital is the organisation's target rate of return for proposed
investment projects.

2.1 Example: NPV
A company is considering a capital investment, where the estimated cash flows are as follows.

8: Investment appraisal using DCF methods

165

Note. The discount factor for any cash flow 'now' (year 0) is always = 1, regardless of what the cost of
capital is.

In this example, the PV of cash inflows exceeds the PV of cash outflows by $56,160, which means that the
project will earn a DCF yield in excess of 15%. It should therefore be undertaken.
(It may also be predicted that the investment should add $56,160 to the value of the company.)

2.2 Timing of cash flows: conventions used in DCF
Discounted cash flow applies discounting arithmetic to the relevant costs and benefits of an investment
project. Discounting, which reduces the value of future cash flows to a present value equivalent, is clearly
concerned with the timing of the cash flows. As a general rule, the following guidelines may be applied.

Exam focus
point

(a)

A cash outlay to be incurred at the beginning of an investment project ('now') occurs in year 0. The
present value of $1 now, in year 0, is $1 regardless of the value of r.

(b)

As explained earlier, a cash outlay, saving or inflow which occurs during the course of a time
period (say, during a year) is assumed to occur all at once at the end of the time period (at the
end of the year). Receipts of $10,000 during year 1 are therefore taken to occur at the end of
year 1.

(c)

A cash outlay or receipt which occurs at the beginning of a time period (say, at the beginning of
one year) is taken to occur at the end of the previous year. Therefore a cash outlay of $5,000 at
the beginning of year 2 is taken to occur at the end of year 1.

The ACCA examining team's reports suggest that candidates often get the timing of cash flows wrong,
particularly initial investment, working capital and tax.

2.3 Discount tables for the PV of $1
The discount factor that we use in discounting is

Instead of having to calculate this factor every time, we can use tables. Discount tables for the present
value of $1, for different values of r and n, are shown in the Appendix to this Study Text. Use these tables
to work out your own solution to the following question.

Exam focus
point

Remember that interest should not be included as a cash flow. Interest is allowed for in the discount rate.

Question

Net present value

LCH manufactures product X which it sells for $5 per unit. Variable costs of production are currently $3
per unit, and fixed costs 50c per unit. A new machine is available which would cost $90,000 but which
could be used to make product X for a variable cost of only $2.50 per unit. Fixed costs, however, would
increase by $7,500 per annum as a direct result of purchasing the machine. The machine would have an
expected life of four years and a resale value after that time of $10,000. Sales of product X are estimated
to be 75,000 units per annum. LCH expects to earn at least 12% per annum from its investments. Ignore
taxation.
You are required to decide whether LCH should purchase the machine.

Answer
Savings are 75,000

($3 – $2.50) = $37,500 per annum.

Additional costs are $7,500 per annum.

166

Net cash savings are therefore $30,000 per annum. (Remember, depreciation is not a cash flow and must
be ignored as a 'cost'.)
The first step in calculating an NPV is to establish the relevant costs year by year. All future cash flows
arising as a direct consequence of the decision should be taken into account. It is assumed that the
machine will be sold for $10,000 at the end of year 4.

Where there is a constant cash flow from year to year, we can calculate the present value by adding
together the discount factors for the individual years.
These total factors could be described as 'same cash flow per annum' factors, 'cumulative present value'
factors or 'annuity' factors.
The present value of an annuity can be calculated by multiplying the annual cash flow in the annuity by the
sum of all the discount factors for the years in the annuity.
Annuity factors for annuities beginning in one year's time (and for different costs of capital) are shown in
the table for cumulative PV factors, which is shown in the Appendix to this Study Text. (2.402, for
example, is in the column for 12% per annum and the row for three years.)

2.5 Annual cash flows in perpetuity
You also need to know how to calculate the cumulative present value of $1 per annum for every year in
perpetuity (that is, forever).

Formula to
learn

When the cost of capital is r, the cumulative PV of $1 per annum in perpetuity is $1/r.
For example, the PV of $1 per annum in perpetuity at a discount rate of 10% would be $1/0.10 = $10.
Similarly, the PV of $1 per annum in perpetuity at a discount rate of 15% would be $1/0.15 = $6.67 and at
a discount rate of 20% it would be $1/0.20 = $5.

Question

Perpetuities

An organisation with a cost of capital of 14% is considering investing in a project costing $500,000. The
project would yield nothing in Year 1, but from Year 2 would yield cash inflows of $100,000 per annum in
perpetuity.

The perpetuity of $100,000 per annum is calculated by multiplying $100,000 by 1/0.14. This gives a
cumulative present value of cash inflows at Year 2 of $714,300.
However, because the cash inflows start only at Year 2, we need to discount the cash inflows back to
1
today's value. This is done by using the present value factor of 0.877 (or

(1 0.14)
The NPV is positive and so the project should be undertaken.

2.6 NPV and shareholder wealth maximisation
If a project has a positive NPV it offers a higher return than the return required by the company to provide
satisfactory returns to its sources of finance. This means that the company's value is increased and the
project contributes to shareholder wealth maximisation.

3 The internal rate of return method
FAST FORWARD

6/15

The internal rate of return (IRR) of an investment is the cost of capital at which its NPV would be exactly
$0.
The IRR method of investment appraisal is an alternative to the NPV method for investment appraisal. This
method is to accept investment projects whose IRR exceeds a target rate of return. The IRR is calculated
approximately using a technique called interpolation.
Using the NPV method of discounted cash flow, present values are calculated by discounting at a target
rate of return, or cost of capital, and the difference between the PV of costs and the PV of benefits is the
NPV. In contrast, the internal rate of return (IRR) method is to calculate the exact DCF rate of return
which the project is expected to achieve; in other words, the rate at which the NPV is zero. If the expected
rate of return (the IRR or DCF yield) exceeds a target rate of return, the project would be worth
undertaking (ignoring risk and uncertainty factors).
Without a computer or calculator program, the calculation of the internal rate of return is made using an
approximating 'hit and miss' technique known as the interpolation method.

Step 1
Step 2

Calculate the net present value using the company's cost of capital.
Having calculated the NPV using the company's cost of capital, calculate the NPV using a
second discount rate.
(a)
(b)

Step 3
Formula to
learn

If the NPV is positive, use a second rate that is greater than the first rate.
If the NPV is negative, use a second rate that is less than the first rate.

Use the two NPV values to estimate the IRR. The formula to apply is as follows.

Note. Ideally NPVa will be a positive value and NPVb will be negative. (If NPVb is negative, then in the
equation above you will be subtracting a negative, ie treating it as an added positive.)

Exam focus
point

Do not worry if you have two positive or two negative values, since the above formula will extrapolate as well as
interpolate. In the exam you will not have time to calculate NPVs using more than two rates.

3.1 Example: The IRR method
A company is trying to decide whether to buy a machine for $80,000 which will save costs of $20,000 per
annum for five years and which will have a resale value of $10,000 at the end of year 5. If it is the
company's policy to undertake projects only if they are expected to yield a DCF return of 10% or more,
ascertain whether this project should be undertaken.

This is fairly close to zero and negative. The IRR is therefore greater than 10% (positive
NPV of $2,030) but less than 12% (negative NPV of $2,230).

Step 3

Use the two NPV values to estimate the IRR.
The interpolation method assumes that the NPV rises in linear fashion between the two
NPVs close to 0. The IRR is therefore assumed to be on a straight line between NPV =
$2,030 at 10% and NPV = –$2,230 at 12%.
Using the formula:

If it is company policy to undertake investments which are expected to yield 10% or more,
this project would be undertaken.
If we were to draw a graph of a 'typical' capital project, with a negative cash flow at the start of the project,
and positive net cash flows afterwards up to the end of the project, we could draw a graph of the project's
NPV at different costs of capital. It would look like Figure 1 below.

Figure 1

If we use a cost of capital where the NPV is slightly positive, and use another cost of capital where it is
slightly negative, we can estimate the IRR – where the NPV is zero – by drawing a straight line between
the two points on the graph that we have calculated. Figure 2 below illustrates this.

Consider Figure 2.
(a)
(b)

If we establish the NPVs at the two points P, we would estimate the IRR to be at point A.
If we establish the NPVs at the two points Q, we would estimate the IRR to be at point B.

The closer our NPVs are to zero, the closer our estimate will be to the true IRR.

4 NPV and IRR compared
FAST FORWARD

There are advantages and disadvantages to each appraisal method. Make sure that you can discuss
them.
Given that there are two methods of using DCF, the NPV method and the IRR method, the relative merits
of each method have to be considered.

4.1 Advantages and disadvantages of IRR method
The main advantage of the IRR method is that the information it provides is more easily understood by
managers, especially non-financial managers. For example, it is fairly easy to understand the meaning of
the following statement.
'The project will be expected to have an initial capital outlay of $100,000, and to earn a yield of 25%. This
is in excess of the target yield of 15% for investments.'
It is not so easy to understand the meaning of this statement.
'The project will cost $100,000 and have an NPV of $30,000 when discounted at the minimum required
rate of 15%.'
However, managers may confuse IRR and accounting return on capital employed, ROCE.
The IRR method ignores the relative size of investments. Both the following projects have an IRR of
18%.
Project A
Project B
$
$
Cost, year 0
350,000
35,000
Annual savings, years 1–6
100,000
10,000
Clearly, project A is bigger (ten times as big) and so more 'profitable' but if the only information on which
the projects were judged were to be their IRR of 18%, project B would be made to seem just as beneficial
as project A, which is not the case.

4.2 Non-conventional cash flows
The projects we have considered so far have had conventional cash flows (an initial cash outflow followed
by a series of inflows). When flows vary from this they are termed non-conventional. The following project
has non-conventional cash flows.
Year
Project X
$'000

-50

The NPV rule suggests that the project is acceptable between costs of capital of 7% and 35%.
Suppose that the required rate on project X is 10% and that the IRR of 7% is used in deciding whether to
accept or reject the project. The project would be rejected since it appears that it can only yield 7%.
The diagram shows, however, that between rates of 7% and 35% the project should be accepted. Using
the IRR of 35% would produce the correct decision to accept the project. Lack of knowledge of multiple
IRRs could therefore lead to serious errors in the decision of whether to accept or reject a project.
In general, if the sign of the net cash flow changes in successive periods, the calculations may produce as
many IRRs as there are sign changes. IRR should not normally be used when there are non-conventional
cash flows.

Exam focus
point

You need to be aware of the possibility of multiple IRRs, but the area is not examinable at a computational
level.

4.3 Mutually exclusive projects
Mutually exclusive projects are two or more projects from which only one can be chosen. Examples
include the choice of a factory location or the choice of just one of a number of machines. The IRR and
NPV methods can, however, give conflicting rankings as to which project should be given priority.
Let us suppose that a company is considering two mutually exclusive options, option A and option B. The
cash flows for each would be as follows.

The IRR of option A is 20% and the IRR of option B is only 18% (workings not shown). On a comparison
of NPVs, option B would be preferred, but on a comparison of IRRs, option A would be preferred.
If the projects were independent this would be irrelevant since under the NPV rule both would be
accepted. With mutually exclusive projects, however, only one project can be accepted. Therefore the
ranking is crucial and we cannot be indifferent to the outcomes of the NPV and IRR appraisal methods.
The NPV method is preferable.

4.4 Reinvestment assumptions
An assumption underlying the NPV method is that any net cash inflows generated during the life of the
project will be reinvested at the cost of capital (that is, the discount rate). The IRR method, on the other
hand, assumes these cash flows can be reinvested to earn a return equal to the IRR of the original project.
In the example above, the NPV method assumes that the cash inflows of $6,000, $5,000 and $3,000 for
option A will be reinvested at the cost of capital of 16% whereas the IRR method assumes they will be
reinvested at 20%. In theory, a firm will have accepted all projects which provide a return in excess of the
cost of capital. Any other funds which become available can only be reinvested at the cost of capital. This
is the assumption implied in the NPV rule, but is unlikely to be the case in practice.

5 Assessment of DCF methods of project appraisal
FAST FORWARD

DCF methods of appraisal have a number of advantages over other appraisal methods.






The time value of money is taken into account.
The method takes account of all a project's cash flows.
It allows for the timing of cash flows.
There are universally accepted methods of calculating the NPV and IRR.

5.1 Advantages of DCF methods
DCF is a capital appraisal technique that is based on a concept known as the time value of money: the
concept that $1 received today is not equal to $1 received in the future. Given the choice between
receiving $100 today and $100 in one year's time, most people would opt to receive $100 today because
they could spend it or invest it to earn interest. If the interest rate was 10%, you could invest $100 today
and it would be worth ($100 1.10) = $110 in one year's time.
There are, however, other reasons why a present $1 is worth more than a future $1.
(a)

Uncertainty. Although there might be a promise of money to come in the future, it can never be
certain that the money will be received until it has actually been paid.

(b)

Inflation. Inflation also means $1 now is worth more than $1 in the future because of inflation. The
time value of money concept applies even if there is zero inflation but inflation obviously increases
the discrepancy in value between monies received at different times.

Taking account of the time value of money (by discounting) is one of the principal advantages of the DCF
appraisal method. Other advantages are as follows.




The method uses all relevant cash flows relating to the project.
It allows for the timing of the cash flows.
There are universally accepted methods of calculating the NPV and the IRR.

5.2 Problems with DCF methods
Although DCF methods are theoretically the best methods of investment appraisal, you should be aware of
their limitations.
(a)

DCF methods use future cash flows that may be difficult to forecast. Although other methods use
these as well, arguably the problem is greater with DCF methods that take cash flows into the
longer term.

(b)

The basic decision rule, accept all projects with a positive NPV, will not apply when the capital
available for investment is rationed.

(c)

The cost of capital used in DCF calculations may be difficult to estimate.

(d)

The cost of capital may change over the life of the investment.

5.3 The use of appraisal methods in practice
One reason for the failure of many businesses to use NPV is that its (sometimes long-term) nature may
conflict with judgements on a business that are concerned with its (short-term) profits. Managers'
remuneration may depend on the level of annual profits, and they may thus be unwilling to risk large
initial expenditure on a project that only offers good returns in the significantly uncertain long term.
In addition, the NPV method is based on the assumption that businesses seek to maximise the wealth of
their shareholders. As discussed previously, this may conflict with the interests of other stakeholders.
Public sector organisations will be concerned with the social opportunity costs.

Even when wealth maximisation is the key objective, there may be factors that help maximise wealth but
cannot be quantified for NPV purposes, for example investment in a loss-making project for strategic
reasons such as obtaining an initial share in an important market.

The ACCA examining team has emphasised that investment appraisal is about modelling the real world
situation. Any discussion of investment appraisal techniques must be applied to the scenario in the
question and should not be just a list of generally applicable points.

Chapter Roundup


The NPV method of investment appraisal is to invest in projects with a positive NPV.



An annuity is a constant cash flow for a number of years. A perpetuity is a constant annual cash flow (an
annuity) that will last forever.



The internal rate of return (IRR) of an investment is the cost of capital at which its NPV would be exactly
$0.



The IRR method of investment appraisal is an alternative to the NPV method for investment appraisal. This
method is to accept investment projects whose IRR exceeds a target rate of return. The IRR is calculated
approximately using a technique called interpolation.

Introduction
Having covered the more sophisticated of the investment appraisal techniques
which are available in Chapter 8, we will be looking in this chapter at how to
incorporate inflation and taxation into investment decisions. A key concept in
this chapter which you must grasp is the difference between nominal rates of
return and real rates of return, and when each is to be used as the discount
rate.
The next chapter will consider how the risk associated with a project can be
assessed and taken into account.

and working capital in an NPV question.

Inflation is a feature of all economies, and it must be accommodated in financial planning.
Nominal cash flows (the actual expected cash flows at future prices, ie including inflationary increases)
should be discounted at a nominal discount rate, which is a rate relating to current market rates of return.
Real cash flows (cash flows in current prices) should be discounted at a real discount rate, which is
based on a nominal cost of capital that has been deflated by the general rate of inflation.
So far we have not considered the effect of inflation on the appraisal of capital investment proposals. As
the inflation rate increases, so will the minimum return required by an investor. For example, you might be
happy with a return of 5% in an inflation-free world, but if inflation were running at 15% you would expect
a considerably greater yield.
The nominal interest rate incorporates inflation. When the nominal rate of interest is higher than the rate
of inflation, there is a positive real rate. When the rate of inflation is higher than the nominal rate of
interest, the real rate of interest will be negative.
The relationship between real and nominal rates of interest is given by the Fisher formula.

The company requires a minimum return of 20% under the present and anticipated conditions. Inflation is
currently running at 10% a year, and this rate of inflation is expected to continue indefinitely. Should the
company go ahead with the project?
Let us first look at the company's required rate of return. Suppose that it invested $1,000 for one year on
1 January, then on 31 December it would require a minimum return of $200. With the initial investment of
$1,000, the total value of the investment by 31 December must therefore increase to $1,200. During the
course of the year the purchasing value of the dollar would fall due to inflation. We can restate the amount
received on 31 December in terms of the purchasing power of the dollar at 1 January as follows.
Amount received on 31 December in terms of the value of the pound at 1 January =

$1,200
(1.10)1

= $1,091

In terms of the value of the dollar at 1 January, the company would make a profit of $91 which represents
a rate of return of 9.1% in 'today's money' terms. This is the real rate of return. The required rate of 20%
is a nominal rate of return (sometimes called a money rate of return). The nominal rate measures the
return in terms of the dollar which is, of course, falling in value. The real rate measures the return in
constant price level terms.

The two rates of return and the inflation rate are linked by the equation (1 + i) = (1 + r)(1 + h) where all
rates are expressed as proportions.
In our example (1 + 0.2) = (1 + r)(1 + 0.1)
1+r =

1.2
= 1.091
1.1

r = 9.1%

Exam focus
point

You may be asked in the exam to explain the difference between a real and nominal terms analysis. It is
worth noting in this context some comments from the June 2017 examining team's report: "Nominal cash
flows, found by inflating by specific rates of inflation, can be deflated by the general rate of inflation to give
real cash flows... Real cash flows can therefore be found by inflating by specific rates of inflation and then
deflating by the general rate of inflation The real-terms approach can only be said to 'ignore inflation' if
only the general rate of inflation is on offer, as there is no need to inflate and then deflate by the same
inflation rate to find real cash flows."

1.2 Do we use the real rate or the nominal rate?
The rule is as follows.
(a)

If the cash flows are expressed in terms of the actual number of dollars that will be received or
paid on the various future dates, we use the nominal rate for discounting.

(b)

If the cash flows are expressed in terms of the value of the dollar at time 0 (that is, in constant
price level terms), we use the real rate.

The cash flows given above are expressed in terms of the actual number of dollars that will be received or
paid at the relevant dates (nominal cash flows). We should, therefore, discount them using the nominal
rate of return.

1.3 The advantages and misuses of real values and a real rate of return
Although generally companies should discount monetary values at the nominal cost of capital, there are
some advantages of using real values discounted at a real cost of capital.
(a)

When all costs and benefits rise at the same rate of price inflation, real values are the same as
current day values, so that no further adjustments need to be made to cash flows before
discounting. In contrast, when nominal values are discounted at the nominal cost of capital, the
prices in future years must be calculated before discounting can begin.

(b)

The government might prefer to set a real return as a target for investments, being more suitable
than a commercial money rate of return.

1.3.1 Costs and benefits which inflate at different rates
Not all costs and benefits will rise in line with the general level of inflation. In such cases, we can apply the
nominal rate to inflated values to determine a project's NPV.

1.4 Example: Inflation (2)
Rice is considering a project which would cost $5,000 now. The annual benefits, for four years, would be
a fixed income of $2,500 a year, plus other savings of $500 a year in year 1, rising by 5% each year
because of inflation. Running costs will be $1,000 in the first year, but would increase at 10% each year
because of inflating labour costs. The general rate of inflation is expected to be 7½% and the company's
required nominal rate of return is 16%. Is the project worthwhile? Ignore taxation.

1.4.1 Variations in the expected rate of inflation
If the rate of inflation is expected to change, the calculation of the nominal cost of capital is slightly more
complicated.

value of the shares is $8,000 ex div. What is the (nominal) cost of the equity capital, if dividends are

1.6 Expectations of inflation and the effects of inflation
When managers evaluate a particular project, or when shareholders evaluate their investments, they can
only guess at what the rate of inflation is going to be. Their expectations will probably be inaccurate,
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the rate of inflation correctly. The only way in which uncertainty
about inflation can be allowed for in project evaluation is by risk and uncertainty analysis. Plans should
be made to obtain 'contingency funds', for example a higher bank overdraft facility if the rate of inflation
exceeds expectations.
Inflation may be general, affecting prices of all kinds, or specific to particular prices. Generalised inflation
has the following effects.
(a)

Since non-current assets and inventories will increase in monetary value, the same quantities of
assets must be financed by increasing amounts of capital.

(b)

Inflation means higher costs and higher selling prices. The effect of higher prices on demand may
not be easy to predict. A company that raises its prices by 10% because the general rate of
inflation is running at 10% might suffer a serious fall in demand.

(c)

Inflation, because it affects financing needs, is also likely to affect gearing, and so the cost of capital.

1.7 Mid-year and end of year monetary values
You might wonder why, in all the examples so far, the cash flows have been inflated to the end of year
money prices. Inflation does not usually run at a steady rate.
In DCF calculations it is more appropriate to use end of year monetary values. This is because, by
convention, all cash flows are assumed to occur at the end of the year, and a discount factor appropriate
to the end of the year is applied.

Taxation is a major practical consideration for businesses. It is vital to take it into account in making
decisions.

In investment appraisal, tax is often assumed to be payable one year in arrears. Tax-allowable
depreciation details should be checked in any question you attempt.
So far, in looking at project appraisal, we have ignored taxation. However, payments of tax, or reductions
of tax payments, are cash flows and ought to be considered in DCF analysis. Assumptions which may be
stated in questions are as follows.

186

(a)

Tax is payable in the year following the one in which the taxable profits are made. Thus, if a
project increases taxable profits by $10,000 in year 2, there will be a tax payment, assuming tax at
30%, of $3,000 in year 3. (However, a question may state that tax is payable in the same year as
the year in which the cash flows giving rise to the tax occur. Read the question carefully.)

(b)

Net operating cash flows from a project should be considered as the taxable profits (not just the
taxable revenues) arising from the project (unless an indication is given to the contrary). This
assumption means that you can ignore adjustments that may otherwise have to be made for
depreciation (not an allowable charge for tax purposes) and the tax relief rules on investment.

Exam focus
point

Check any question involving tax carefully to see what assumptions about tax rates are made. Also look
out for questions which state that tax is payable in the year following that in which the profits arise. This
may mean that if you are evaluating a project with, for example, a four year life – there will still be a year 5
cash flow for tax that is due to be paid on year 4's profits.

2.1 Tax-allowable depreciation
Tax-allowable depreciation (capital allowances) is used to reduce taxable profits, and the consequent
reduction in a tax payment should be treated as a cash saving arising from the acceptance of a project.
Tax-allowable depreciation is not the same as the depreciation charge for the purpose of reporting profit in
the financial statements.
For example, suppose tax-allowable depreciation is allowed on the cost of plant and machinery at the rate
of 25% on a reducing balance basis. Thus if a company purchases plant costing $80,000, the subsequent
writing down allowances would be as follows.
Year

When the plant is eventually sold, the difference between the sale price and the reducing balance amount
at the time of sale will be treated as:
(a)
(b)

Exam focus
point

A taxable profit if the sale price exceeds the reducing balance
A tax-allowable loss if the reducing balance exceeds the sale price

Examination questions often assume that this loss will be available immediately, though in practice the
balance less the sale price continues to be written off at 25% a year as part of a pool balance.
The cash saving on tax-allowable depreciation (or the cash payment for the charge) is calculated by
multiplying the amount of the tax-allowable depreciation by the tax rate. If tax cash flows occur in the year
following the year in which the item giving rise to the tax occurs, the cash flow for the tax saving from
tax-allowable depreciation will occur in the year following the year in which the allowance is claimed.
In the example above, for instance, if the rate of tax on profits is 30%, the tax-allowable depreciation for
Year 1 will be $6,000 (= $20,000 30%) and this cash flow saving will occur in Year 2.
Assumptions about tax-allowable depreciation could be simplified in an exam question. For example, you
might be told that tax-allowable depreciation can be claimed at the rate of 25% of cost on a straight line
basis (that is, over four years).
There are two possible assumptions about the time when tax-allowable depreciation starts to be claimed.
(a)
(b)

It can be assumed that the first claim occurs at the start of the project (at year 0).
Alternatively it can be assumed that the first claim occurs later in the first year.

Examination questions will generally indicate which of the two assumptions is required but you should
state your assumptions clearly if you have to make assumptions. Assumption (b) is easier to use since
there is one claim for tax-allowable depreciation for each year of the project.

Exam focus
point

A common mistake in exams is to include the tax-allowable depreciation itself in the NPV calculation; it is
the tax effect of the allowance that should be included.

2.2 Example: Taxation
A company is considering whether or not to purchase an item of machinery costing $40,000 payable
immediately. It would have a life of four years, after which it would be sold for $5,000. The machinery
would create annual cost savings of $14,000.
The company pays tax one year in arrears at an annual rate of 30% and can claim tax-allowable
depreciation on a 25% reducing balance basis. A balancing allowance is claimed in the final year of
operation. The company's cost of capital is 8%.
Should the machinery be purchased?

2.3 Taxation and DCF
The effect of taxation on capital budgeting is theoretically quite simple. Organisations must pay tax, and
the effect of undertaking a project will be to increase or decrease tax payments each year. These
incremental tax cash flows should be included in the cash flows of the project for discounting to arrive at
the project's NPV.
When taxation is ignored in the DCF calculations, the discount rate will reflect the pre-tax rate of return
required on capital investments. When taxation is included in the cash flows, a post-tax required rate of
return should be used.

Question

DCF and taxation

A company is considering the purchase of an item of equipment, which would earn profits before tax of
$25,000 a year. Depreciation charges would be $20,000 a year for six years. Tax-allowable depreciation
would be $30,000 a year for the first four years. Tax is at 30%.
What would the annual net cash inflows of the project be:
(a)
(b)

For the first four years?
For the fifth and sixth years?

Assume that tax payments occur in the same year as the profits giving rise to them, and there is no
balancing charge or allowance when the machine is scrapped at the end of the sixth year.

Question

Tax implications

A company is considering the purchase of a machine for $150,000. It would be sold after four years for an
estimated realisable value of $50,000. By this time tax-allowable depreciation of $120,000 would have
been claimed. The rate of tax is 30%.
What are the tax implications of the sale of the machine at the end of four years?

Answer
There will be a balancing charge on the sale of the machine of $(50,000 – (150,000 – 120,000)) = $20,000.
This will give rise to a tax payment of 30% $20,000 = $6,000.

Exam focus
point

In reality, tax on profits may be paid quarterly but the timing is simplified in a DCF calculation and an exam
question will tell you what assumptions to use.

3 NPV layout
When answering an NPV question, you may find it helpful to use the following layout. The most important
thing to notice is that tax on cash profits and cash flows arising from tax-allowable depreciation can be
calculated and presented separately. There is no need to combine them into a single cash flow figure for
tax.

3.1 Working capital and inflation
We saw how to calculate working capital cash flows in Chapter 4. This calculation is complicated when
inflation is also to be considered.
When working capital is recovered at the end of the project it has a different nominal value to the working
capital that was invested at the beginning. The nominal value of the investment should be inflated each
period to maintain its real value. If the inflation rate is known then the incremental working capital can be
included in the NPV appraisal as a relevant cost. The full nominal value of the working capital investment
is recovered at the end of the project.
If for example a three-year project required $500,000 of working capital initially, the inflation rate was 5%
and the working capital is recovered at the end of the project, then the relevant cash flows would be:



Inflation is a feature of all economies, and it must be accommodated in financial planning.
Real cash flows (cash flows in current prices) should be discounted at a real discount rate.
Nominal cash flows (the actual expected cash flows at future prices, ie including inflationary increases)
should be discounted at a nominal discount rate, which is a rate relating to current market rates of return.



Taxation is a major practical consideration for businesses. It is vital to take it into account in making

Risk analysis can be applied to a proposed capital investment where there are several possible outcomes
and, on the basis of past relevant experience, probabilities can be assigned to the various outcomes and
estimated cash flows that could prevail.
Uncertainty analysis can be applied to a proposed capital investment where there are several possible
outcomes but there is little past relevant experience to enable the probability of the alternative outcomes to
be predicted.
There are a wide range of techniques for incorporating risk into project appraisal.
A distinction should be made between the terms risk and uncertainty.

Risk can be quantified, so it can be built into a project's NPV.

 Uncertainty cannot be quantified, the potential impact of an uncertain variable
on a project's NPV can only be described.
A risky situation is one where we can say that there is a 70% probability that returns from a project will be
$150,000 and a 30% probability that returns will be less than $50,000. This is more risky than an
investment where there is a 70% probability that returns will be $110,000 and a 30% probability that

196

Part D Investment

w


returns will be $90,000. The variability of returns, which could be measured statistically, is lower with this
second investment, which is why it is less risky.
If, however, no information can be provided about the probabilities of different returns from the project,
we are faced with an uncertain situation. For example, we might estimate that returns from an investment
could be anything between $150,000 and $50,000, but we can't estimate probabilities. This would be
uncertainty about the investment returns.
In general, risky projects are those whose predicted possible future cash flows, and therefore the project
returns, are more variable. The greater the variability, the greater the risk. The problem of risk is more
acute with capital investment decisions than other decisions for the following reasons.

Exam focus
point

(a)

Estimates of capital expenditure might be for several years ahead, such as for major construction
projects. Actual costs may escalate well above budget as the work progresses.

(b)

Estimates of benefits will be for several years ahead, sometimes 10, 15 or 20 years ahead or even
longer, and such long-term estimates can at best be approximations.

Make sure you can explain the difference between risk and uncertainty. This was required in June 2015
and the ACCA examining team commented that it caused difficulties. They went on to say that 'a key point
in providing a good answer to this question was recognising that risk could be quantified, using
probabilities, unlike uncertainty'.

Key term

6/15, 12/15, 6/16, 12/16

Sensitivity analysis assesses how responsive the project's NPV is to changes in the variables used to
calculate that NPV. Sensitivity analysis is one particular approach to uncertainty analysis.
Sensitivity analysis is a key method of analysing the uncertainty surrounding a capital expenditure
project and enables an assessment to be made of how responsive the project's NPV is to changes in the
variables that are used to calculate that NPV.
The NPV could depend on a number of uncertain independent variables.

Selling price
Sales volume

Initial cost

Benefits

The basic approach of sensitivity analysis is to calculate the project's NPV under alternative
assumptions to determine how sensitive it is to changing conditions. An indication is thus provided of
those variables to which the NPV is most sensitive (critical variables) and the extent to which those
variables may change before the investment results in a negative NPV.
Sensitivity analysis therefore provides an indication of why a project might fail. Management should
review critical variables to assess whether or not there is a strong possibility of events occurring which
will lead to a negative NPV. Management should also pay particular attention to controlling those variables
to which the NPV is particularly sensitive, once the decision has been taken to accept the investment.
A simple approach to deciding which variables the NPV is particularly sensitive to is to calculate the
sensitivity of each variable.
Sensitivity =

NPV
%
Pr esent value of project variable

The lower the percentage, the more sensitive the NPV is to that project variable, as the variable would
need to change by a smaller amount to make the project non-viable.

The cost of capital can therefore increase by 132% before the NPV becomes negative.
The elements to which the NPV appears to be most sensitive are the selling price followed by the sales
volume. Management should thus pay particular attention to these factors so that they can be carefully
monitored.

2.2 Weaknesses of this approach
These are as follows.
(a)

The method requires that changes in each key variable are isolated, assuming that all other values
in the estimated cash flows are unchanged. However, management may be more interested in the
combination of the effects of changes in two or more key variables.

(b)

Looking at factors in isolation is unrealistic since they are often interdependent.

(c)

Sensitivity analysis is analysis when there is uncertainty. It does not examine the probability that
any particular variation in costs or revenues might occur.

(d)

Critical factors may be those over which managers have no control.

(e)

In itself it does not provide a decision rule. Parameters defining acceptability of an investment
project, given the uncertainty, must be laid down by managers.

A probability analysis of expected cash flows can often be estimated and used both to calculate an
expected NPV and to measure risk. The certainty-equivalent approach is a similar approach; this involves
the conversion of the expected cash flows of the project to riskless equivalent amounts.
A probability distribution of 'expected cash flows' can often be estimated, recognising that there are
several possible outcomes, not just one. This may be used to do the following.

Step 1
Step 2

Calculate an expected value of the NPV.
Measure risk, for example in the following ways.

By calculating the worst possible outcome and its probability
By calculating the probability that the project will fail to achieve a positive NPV
By calculating the standard deviation of the NPV

3.1 Example: Probability estimates of cash flows

First we need to draw up a probability distribution of the expected cash flows. We begin by
calculating the present values of the cash flows.

Since the EV of the NPV is positive, the project should go ahead unless the risk is
unacceptably high. The probability that the project will have a negative NPV is the
probability that the total PV of cash inflows is less than $300,000. From the column headed
'Total PV of cash inflows', we can establish that this probability is 0.0625 + 0.125 + 0.0625
+ 0.125 = 0.375 or 37.5%. This might be considered an unacceptably high risk.

Using probabilities to assess risk need not involve discounting. Here is an example.
A company has an overdraft limit of $500,000. There are concerns that this limit may be exceeded within
the next two years. As a result cash flow forecasts with their associated probabilities have been prepared
for the next two periods, as follows.

3.3 Problems with expected values
There are the following problems with using expected values in making investment decisions.



202

An investment may be one-off, and 'expected' NPV may never actually occur. For example, if there
is a 50% probability that the NPV will be + $10,000 and a 50% probability that it will be $(2,000),
the EV of the NPV is + $4,000. On this basis the project will go ahead. However, an NPV of $4,000
is not expected to happen. The NPV will be either plus $10,000 or minus $2,000.

10: Project appraisal and risk

Part D Investment

w




Assigning probabilities to future events and outcomes is usually highly subjective.



Expected values do not evaluate the range of possible NPV outcomes.

3.4 The certainty-equivalent approach

12/15

Another method is the certainty-equivalent approach. By this method, the expected cash flows of the project
are converted to riskless equivalent amounts. The greater the risk of an expected cash flow, the smaller
the certainty-equivalent value (for receipts) or the larger the certainty-equivalent value (for payments).
As the cash flows are reduced to supposedly certain amounts, they should be discounted at a risk-free
rate. This concept will be covered in detail later in this text, but the risk-free rate is effectively the level of
return that can be obtained from undertaking no risk.
Because this approach reduces the estimated project cash flows to an ultra-safe level (ie the cash flows
could be no worse than this level), this can be thought of as a 'conservative approach' to project appraisal.

3.5 Example: Certainty-equivalent approach
Dark Ages Co, whose cost of capital is 10%, is considering a project with the following expected cash
flows.

NPV = +4,248

The project seems to be worthwhile. However, because of the uncertainty about the future cash receipts,
the management decides to reduce them to 'certainty-equivalents' by taking only 70%, 60% and 50% of
the years 1, 2 and 3 cash flows respectively. The risk-free rate is 5%.
On the basis of the information set out above, assess whether the project is worthwhile.

Solution
The risk-adjusted NPV of the project is as follows.

NPV = (454)

The project's certainty-equivalent NPV is negative. This means that the project is too risky and should be
rejected.
The disadvantage of the 'certainty-equivalent' approach is that the amount of the adjustment to each cash
flow is decided subjectively.

4 Other techniques for dealing with risk and uncertainty
4.1 Simulation
FAST FORWARD

Mar/Jun 18

Other techniques include the use of simulation models (to describe uncertainty), discounted payback (to
describe uncertainty) and risk-adjusted discount rates (to quantify risk).
Simulation will overcome problems of having a very large number of uncertain outcomes, as well as the
correlation of cash flows (a project which is successful in its early years is more likely to be successful in
its later years).

The cost of capital is 12%. Assess how a simulation model might be used to assess the project's NPV.

Solution
A simulation model could be constructed by assigning a range of random number digits to each possible
value for each of the uncertain variables. The random numbers must exactly match their respective
probabilities. This is achieved by working upwards cumulatively from the lowest to the highest cash flow
values and assigning numbers that will correspond to probability groupings, as follows.

Probability is 0.40 (40%). Random numbers are 40% of range 00 – 99 but starting at 15.
Probability is 0.30 (30%). Random numbers are 30% of range 00 – 99 but starting at 55.

For revenue, the selection of a random number in the range 00 and 14 has a probability of 0.15. This
probability represents revenue of $40,000. Numbers have been assigned to cash flows so that when
numbers are selected at random, the cash flows have exactly the same probability of being selected as is
indicated in their respective probability distribution above.
Random numbers would be generated, for example by a computer program, and these would be used to
assign values to each of the uncertain variables.

For example, if random numbers 37, 84, 20, 01, 56 and 89 were generated, the values assigned to the

4.3 Discounted payback (adjusted payback)
FAST FORWARD

Sep/Dec 17, Mar/Jun 18

The discounted payback period (DPP) is the time it will take before a project's cumulative NPV turns from
being negative to being positive.
The payback method of investment appraisal, discussed in Chapter 7, recognises uncertainty in
investment decisions by focusing on the near future. Short-term projects are preferred to long-term
projects and liquidity is emphasised.
The discounted payback period is the length of time before the cumulative PV of cash inflows from the
projects begins to exceed the initial outflow. It is similar to the payback method, but uses discounted cash
flows rather than non-discounted cash flows to measure the payback period.
Discounted payback uses discounted cash flows. This is also known as adjusted payback.

For example, if we have a cost of capital of 10% and a project with the cash flows shown below, we can
calculate a discounted payback period.

The DPP is early in year 4.
It may be approximated as 3 years + [1,390/(1,390 + 19,100)] × 12 months
= 3 years 0.8 months, say 3 years 1 month.
A company can set a target DPP, and choose not to undertake any projects with a DPP in excess of a
certain number of years, say, five years.

4.4 Advantages and disadvantages of discounted payback period
The approach has all the perceived advantages of the payback period method of investment appraisal: it
is easy to understand and calculate, and it provides a focus on liquidity where this is relevant. In addition,

Part D Investment appraisal
w

10: Project appraisal and risk

205

however, it also takes into account the time value of money. It therefore bridges the gap between the
theoretically superior NPV method and the regular payback period method.
However, it does differ from NPV in that the discount rate used is the unadjusted cost of capital whereas
NPV often uses an adjusted rate to reflect project risk and uncertainty.
Because the DPP approach takes the time value of money into consideration, it produces a longer
payback period than the non-discounted payback approach, and takes into account more of the project's
cash flows.
Another advantage it has over traditional payback is that it has a clear accept or reject criterion. Using
payback, acceptance of a project depends on an arbitrarily determined cut-off time. Using DPP, a project is
acceptable if it pays back within its lifetime.
DPP still shares one disadvantage with the payback period method: cash flows which occur after the
payback period are ignored (although, as the DPP is longer than the payback period, fewer of these are
ignored).
One way of dealing with risk is to shorten the payback period required. A maximum payback period can
be set to reflect the fact that risk increases the longer the time period under consideration. However, the
disadvantages of payback as an investment appraisal method (discussed in Section 3.2 of Chapter 7)
mean that discounted payback cannot be recommended as a method of adjusting for risk.

4.5 Risk-adjusted discount rates

12/16, Mar/Jun 18

Investors want higher returns for higher risk investments. The greater the risk attached to future returns,
the greater the risk premium required. Investors also prefer cash now to later and require a higher return
for longer time periods.
In investment appraisal, a risk-adjusted discount rate can be used for particular types or risk classes of
investment projects to reflect their relative risks. This concept is developed further in Chapter 16.
For example, a high discount rate can be used so that a cash flow which occurs quite some time in the
future will have less effect on the decision. Alternatively, with the launch of a new product, a higher initial
risk premium may be used with a decrease in the discount rate as the product becomes established.



Risk analysis can be applied to a proposed capital investment where there are several possible outcomes
and, on the basis of past relevant experience, probabilities can be assigned to the various outcomes and
estimated cash flows that could prevail.



Uncertainty analysis can be applied to a proposed capital investment where there are several possible
outcomes but there is little past relevant experience to enable the probability of the alternative outcomes to
be predicted.



There are a wide range of techniques for incorporating risk into project appraisal.



Sensitivity analysis assesses how responsive the project's NPV is to changes in the variables used to
calculate that NPV. Sensitivity analysis is one particular approach to uncertainty analysis.



A probability analysis of expected cash flows can often be estimated and used both to calculate an
expected NPV and to measure risk. The certainty-equivalent approach is a similar approach; this involves
the conversion of the expected cash flows of the project to riskless equivalent amounts.



Other techniques include the use of simulation models (to describe uncertainty), discounted payback (to

1 Lease or buy decisions
FAST FORWARD

Leasing is a commonly used source of finance, and can be especially attractive where companies find it
difficult to raise finance to fund capital expenditure.

1.1 The nature of leasing
Rather than buying an asset outright, using either available cash resources or borrowed funds, a business
may lease an asset.

Key terms

Leasing is a contract between a lessor and a lessee for hire of a specific asset by the lessee from a
manufacturer or vendor of such assets.
The lessor has ownership of the asset and so provides the initial finance for the asset.
The lessee has possession and use of the asset on payment of specified rentals over a period.

1.2 Leases that minimise risk to the lessee
Some leases, often short-term leases, are rental agreements between a lessor and a lessee, that are
structured so that the lessor retains most of the risks of ownership, ie the lessor is responsible for
servicing and maintaining the leased equipment. The risk of ownership is also minimised for the lessee
because if there is a change in technology then the lessee can exit from the rental agreement at the end of
the lease term and is therefore not tied in to using assets that are technologically out of date.

1.3 Leases that are purely a source of finance
Some leases are long-term arrangements that transfer the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to
the lessee. These are agreements between the lessee and the lessor for most or all of the asset's expected
useful life. The lessee is responsible for the upkeep, servicing and maintenance of the asset.
This can be a cheaper source of finance than a bank loan if the lessor buys a large quantity of assets (eg
aircraft) and obtains bulk purchase discounts as a result; some of the savings from such discounts can be
shared with the lessee in the form of lower rental payments.

1.4 Sale and leaseback
Key term

Sale and leaseback is when a business that owns an asset agrees to sell the asset to a financial institution
and lease it back on terms specified in the sale and leaseback agreement.
The business retains use of the asset but has the funds from the sale, while having to pay rent.
A common form of sale and leaseback arrangement has involved commercial property. A company might
sell its premises to a bank or finance company (to raise cash) and then lease back the premises under a
long-term leasing arrangement.

1.5 Attractions of leasing
Attractions include the following.
(a)

The supplier of the equipment is paid in full at the beginning. The equipment is sold to the lessor
and, other than guarantees, the supplier has no further financial concern about the asset.

(b)

The lessor invests finance by purchasing assets from suppliers and makes a return out of the
lease payments from the lessee. The lessor will also get capital allowances (tax-allowable
depreciation) on the purchase of the equipment.

(c)

Leasing may have advantages for the lessee.
(i)

The lessee may not have enough cash to pay for the asset, and would have difficulty
obtaining a bank loan to buy it. If so, the lessee has to rent the asset to obtain use of it at all.

(ii)

Leasing may be cheaper than a bank loan if the lessor obtains bulk purchase discounts
(as discussed earlier).

(iii)

If the equipment is leased for a shorter period than its expected useful life. In the case of
high-technology equipment, if the equipment becomes out of date before the end of its
expected life, the lessee does not have to keep on using it.

A major growth area in short-term leasing in the UK has been in computers and office equipment (such as
photocopiers) where technology is continually improving.

1.6 Lease or buy decisions
FAST FORWARD

The decision whether to lease or buy an asset is a financing decision which interacts with the investment
decision to buy the asset. The assumption is that the preferred financing method should be the one with
the lower PV of cost. We identify the least-cost financing option by comparing the cash flows of
purchasing and leasing. We assume that if the asset is purchased, it will be financed with a bank loan;
therefore the cash flows are discounted at an after-tax cost of borrowing.

Part D Investment appraisal
w

11: Specific investment decisions

213

The decision of whether to buy or lease an asset is made once the decision to invest in the asset has been
made.
Discounted cash flow techniques are used to evaluate the lease or buy decision so that the least-cost
financing option can be chosen.
The cost of capital that should be applied to the cash flows for the financing decision is the cost of
borrowing. Assuming that the lessee is in a tax paying position then the cost of borrowing should be after
tax. This can be calculated as the post-tax cost of borrowing. This can be calculated as the pre-tax cost of
borrowing multiplied by (1 – tax rate). If the company is not in a tax paying position or an exam question
says that tax should be ignored then the pre-tax cost of borrowing can be used. We assume that if the
organisation decided to purchase the equipment, it would finance the purchase by borrowing funds (rather
than out of retained funds). We therefore compare the cost of purchasing with the cash flows of leasing
by applying this cost of borrowing to the financing cash flows.
The cash flows of purchasing do not include the interest repayments on the loan, as these are dealt with
via the cost of capital.
An important cash flow difference between leasing and buying is that:



With buying the asset, the company receives the tax allowances (tax-allowable depreciation).
With leasing, the lessor and not the lessee receives these allowances.

With leasing, the lease rental is allowable for tax purposes, and there are consequently savings in tax cash
flows.

1.7 A simple example
Brown Co has decided to invest in a new machine which has a ten-year life and no residual value. The
machine can either be purchased now for $50,000, or it can be leased for ten years with lease rental
payments of $8,000 per annum payable at the end of each year.
The cost of capital to be applied is 9% and taxation should be ignored.

Solution
Present value of leasing costs
PV = Annuity factor at 9% for 10 years × $8,000
= 6.418 × $8,000 = $51,344
If the machine was purchased now, it would cost $50,000. The purchase is therefore the least-cost
financing option.

1.8 An example with taxation
Mallen and Mullins has decided to install a new milling machine. The machine costs $20,000 and it would
have a useful life of five years with a trade-in value of $4,000 at the end of the fifth year. A decision now
has to be taken on the method of financing the project.
(a)

The company could purchase the machine for cash, using bank loan facilities on which the current
rate of interest is 13% before tax.

(b)

The company could lease the machine under an agreement which would entail payment of $4,800
at the end of each year for the next five years.

The rate of tax is 30%. If the machine is purchased, the company will be able to claim a tax depreciation
allowance of 100% in Year 1. Tax is payable with a year's delay.

1.9 The position of the lessor
Exam focus
point

So far, we have looked at examples of leasing decisions from the viewpoint of the lessee. You may be
asked to evaluate a leasing arrangement from the position of the lessor. This is rather like a mirror image
of the lessee's position.
The lessor will receive tax-allowable depreciation on the expenditure, and the lease payments will be
taxable income.

1.10 Example: Lessor's position
Continuing the same case of Mallen and Mullins, suppose that the lessor's required rate of return is 12%
after tax. The lessor can claim 25% reducing balance tax depreciation. The lessor's cash flows will be as
follows.

*$20,000 – $4,000 scrap – total claims in Years 1 – 4

Question

Lease or buy

The management of a company has decided to acquire Machine X which costs $63,000 and has an
operational life of four years. The expected scrap value would be zero. Tax is payable at 30% on operating
cash flows one year in arrears. Tax-allowable depreciation is available at 25% a year on a reducing balance
basis.
Suppose that the company has the opportunity either to purchase the machine or to lease it at an annual
rent of $20,000 for four years, payable at the end of each year. The company can borrow to finance the
acquisition at a pre-tax cost of borrowing of 10%. Should the company lease or buy the machine?

2 Asset replacement decisions
FAST FORWARD

12/14

DCF techniques can assist asset replacement decisions, to decide how frequently an asset should be
replaced. When an asset is being replaced with an identical asset, the equivalent annual cost method can
be used to calculate an optimum replacement cycle.
As well as assisting with decisions between particular assets, DCF techniques can be used in asset
replacement decisions to assess when and how frequently an asset should be replaced. When an asset is
to be replaced by an 'identical' asset, the problem is to decide the optimum interval between
replacements. As the asset gets older, it may cost more to maintain and operate, its residual value will
decrease and it may lose some productivity/operating capability.

2.1 Equivalent annual cost method
The equivalent annual cost method is the most convenient method of analysis to use in a period of no
inflation. With this method, the NPV of the cost of buying and using the asset over its life cycle is
converted into an equivalent annual cost or annuity. This is a constant annual cost that is equal to the NPV
of the costs over the asset life cycle. An equivalent annual cost can be calculated for each possible length
of asset replacement cycle. The least-cost replacement cycle is the one with the lowest equivalent annual
cost.

Step 1

Calculate the present value of costs for each replacement cycle over one cycle only.
These costs are not comparable because they refer to different time periods, whereas
replacement is continuous.

Step 2

Turn the present value of costs for each replacement cycle into an equivalent annual cost
(an annuity).
The equivalent annual cost is calculated as follows.

The PV of cost over one replacement cycle
The cumulative present value factor for the number of years in the cycle
For example if there are three years in the cycle, the denominator will be the present value
of an annuity for three years at 10% (2.487).

An alternative project B with an NPV of $4.45m and a duration of 7 years will have an equivalent annual

3 Capital rationing
FAST FORWARD

Key terms

12/14, Sep/Dec 15, 12/16

Capital rationing may occur due to internal factors (soft capital rationing) or external factors (hard capital
rationing).

Capital rationing is a situation in which a company has a limited amount of capital to invest in potential
projects, such that the different possible investments need to be compared with one another in order to
allocate the capital available most effectively.
Soft capital rationing is brought about by internal factors and decisions by management.
Hard capital rationing is brought about by external factors, such as limited availability of new external
finance.

If an organisation is in a capital rationing situation it will not be able to enter into all projects with positive
NPVs because there is not enough capital for all the investments.

3.1 Soft and hard capital rationing
Soft capital rationing may arise for one of the following reasons.

(a)

Management may be reluctant to issue additional share capital because of concern that this may
lead to outsiders gaining control of the business.

(b)

Management may be unwilling to issue additional share capital if it will lead to a dilution of
earnings per share.

(c)

Management may not want to raise additional debt capital because they do not wish to be
committed to large fixed interest payments.

(d)

Management may wish to limit investment to a level that can be financed solely from retained
earnings.

Hard capital rationing may arise for one of the following reasons.

(a)

Raising new finance through the stock market may not be possible if share prices are depressed.

(b)

There may be restrictions on bank lending due to government control.

(c)

Lending institutions may consider an organisation to be too risky to be granted further loan
facilities.

(d)

The costs associated with making small issues of capital may be too great.

3.2 Relaxation of capital constraints
If an organisation adopts a policy that restricts funds available for investment (soft capital rationing), the
policy may be less than optimal. The organisation may reject projects with a positive net present value and
forgo opportunities that would have enhanced the market value of the organisation.
A company may be able to limit the effects of hard capital rationing and exploit new opportunities.

220

(a)

It might seek joint venture partners with which to share projects.

(b)

As an alternative to direct investment in a project, the company may be able to consider a licensing
or franchising agreement with another enterprise, under which the licensor/franchisor company
would receive royalties.

(c)

It may be possible to contract out parts of a project to reduce the initial capital outlay required.

11: Specific investment decisions

Part D Investment
appraisal
w


(d)

The company may seek new alternative sources of capital (subject to any restrictions which apply
to it), for example:
(i)
Venture capital
(ii)
Debt finance secured on the assets of the project
(iii)
Sale and leaseback of property or equipment (see the next chapter)
(iv)
Grant aid
(v)
More effective capital management

3.3 Single period capital rationing
FAST FORWARD

When capital rationing occurs in a single period, projects are ranked in terms of profitability index. This
is the ratio of the NPV of a project to its investment cost. The projects with the highest ratios should be
selected for investment.
We shall begin our analysis by assuming that capital rationing occurs in a single period, and that capital is
freely available at all other times.
The following further assumptions will be made.
(a)

If a company does not accept and undertake a project during the period of capital rationing, the
opportunity to undertake it is lost. The project cannot be postponed until a subsequent period
when no capital rationing exists.

(b)

There is complete certainty about the outcome of each project, so that the choice between projects
is not affected by considerations of risk.

(c)

Projects are divisible, so that it is possible to undertake, say, half of Project X in order to earn half
of the net present value (NPV) of the whole project.

The basic approach is to rank all investment opportunities so that the NPVs can be maximised from the
use of the available funds.
Ranking in terms of absolute NPVs will normally give incorrect results. This method leads to the selection
of large projects, each of which has a high individual NPV but which have, in total, a lower NPV than a
large number of smaller projects with lower individual NPVs. Ranking is therefore in terms of what is
called the profitability index.
This profitability index is a ratio that measures the PV of future cash flows per $1 of investment, and so
indicates which investments make the best use of the limited resources available.

Key term

Profitability index is the ratio of the present value of the project's future cash flows (not including the
capital investment) divided by the present value of the total capital investment.

Without capital rationing all four projects would be viable investments. Suppose, however, that only
$60,000 was available for capital investment. Let us look at the resulting NPV if we select projects in the
order of ranking per NPV.

* Projects are divisible. By spending the balancing $20,000 on project Y, two-thirds of the full investment

would be made to earn two-thirds of the NPV.
Suppose, on the other hand, that we adopt the profitability index approach. The selection of projects will
be as follows.

By choosing projects according to the PI, the resulting NPV (if only $60,000 is available) is increased by
$496.

3.4.1 Problems with the Profitability Index method
(a)

The approach can only be used if projects are divisible. If the projects are not divisible, a decision
has to be made by examining the absolute NPVs of all possible combinations of complete projects
that can be undertaken within the constraints of the capital available. The combination of projects
which remains at or under the limit of available capital without any of them being divided, and
which maximises the total NPV, should be chosen.

(b)

The selection criterion is fairly simplistic, taking no account of the possible strategic value of
individual investments in the context of the overall objectives of the organisation.

(c)

The method is of limited use when projects have differing cash flow patterns. These patterns may
be important to the company since they will affect the timing and availability of funds. With
multi-period capital rationing, it is possible that the project with the highest Profitability Index is the
slowest in generating returns.

(d)

The Profitability Index ignores the absolute size of individual projects. A project with a high index
might be very small and therefore only generate a small NPV.

Question

Capital rationing

A company is experiencing capital rationing in year 0, when only $60,000 of investment finance will be
available. No capital rationing is expected in future periods, but none of the three projects under
consideration by the company can be postponed. The expected cash flows of the three projects are as
follows.

The cost of capital is 10%. You are required to decide which projects should be undertaken in year 0, in
view of the capital rationing, given that projects are divisible.

Exam focus
point

The June 2014 exam contained a calculation question on the profitability index. The question stated that
two of the projects were mutually exclusive. The ACCA examining team commented that some students did
not know what mutually exclusive meant, as they included both of the projects. If two projects are mutually
exclusive then only one of them can be undertaken.

3.5 Postponing projects
We have so far assumed that projects cannot be postponed until year 1. If this assumption is removed, the
choice of projects in year 0 would be made by reference to the loss of NPV from postponement.

3.6 Example: Postponing projects
The figures in the previous exercise will be used to illustrate the method. If any project, A, B or C, were
delayed by one year, the 'NPV' would now relate to year 1 values, so that in year 0 terms the NPVs would
be as follows.
NPV in Year 0
NPV in Year 1

therefore more profitable to postpone A, rather than B or C, as follows.

3.7 Single period rationing with non-divisible projects
If the projects are not divisible then the method shown above may not result in the optimal solution.
Another complication which arises is that there is likely to be a small amount of unused capital with each
combination of projects. The best way to deal with this situation is to use trial and error and test the NPV
available from different combinations of projects. This can be a laborious process if there are a large
number of projects available.



Leasing is a commonly used source of finance, and can be especially attractive where companies find it
difficult to raise finance to fund capital expenditure.



The decision whether to lease or buy an asset is a financing decision which interacts with the investment
decision to buy the asset. The assumption is that the preferred financing method should be the one with
the lower PV of cost. We identify the least-cost financing option by comparing the cash flows of
purchasing and leasing. We assume that if the asset is purchased, it will be financed with a bank loan;
therefore the cash flows are discounted at an after-tax cost of borrowing.



DCF techniques can assist asset replacement decisions, to decide how frequently an asset should be
replaced. When an asset is being replaced with an identical asset, the equivalent annual cost method can
be used to calculate an optimum replacement cycle.



Capital rationing may occur due to internal factors (soft capital rationing) or external factors (hard capital
rationing).



When capital rationing occurs in a single period, projects are ranked in terms of profitability index. This
is the ratio of the NPV of a project to its investment cost. The projects with the highest ratios should be
selected for investment.

Introduction
In Part E of this study text we consider sources of finance. In this chapter we
will look at the distinction between short- and long-term sources of finance.
When sources of long-term finance are used, large sums are usually involved,
and so the financial manager needs to consider all the options available with
care, looking at the possible effects on the company in the long term.
If a company decides to raise new equity finance, it needs to consider which
method would be best for its circumstances.
Also considered here is the growth area of Islamic finance and how it differs
from the other forms of financing covered.

Exam guide
Sources of finance are a major topic. You may be asked to describe appropriate sources of finance for a
particular company, and also discuss in general terms when different sources of finance should be utilised
and when they are likely to be available.
Performance objective 10 requires you to 'source short-term finance to improve an organisation's
liquidity'. You can apply the knowledge you obtain from this chapter of the text to help to demonstrate this
competence.
