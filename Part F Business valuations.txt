If you are asked to value a business, check the wording of the question carefully to establish whether you
are being asked to estimate a value for the business as a whole, or just its equity shares.

1.2 Business valuation methods
There are a number of different methods of valuing a business. Each of the methods give different values,
and are suitable in different situations.
Max

Value the cash flows or earnings under new ownership

Value the dividends under the existing management

Min

Value the assets

We will look at each of the valuation methods in this chapter.

1.3 Information requirements for valuation
There is a wide range of information that can be used to value a business.


Financial statements: statements of financial position and comprehensive income, statements of
changes in financial position and statements of shareholders' equity for the past five years



Summary of non-current assets and depreciation schedule



Aged accounts-receivable summary



Aged accounts-payable summary



List of marketable securities



Inventory summary



Details of any existing contracts: eg leases, supplier agreements



List of shareholders with number of shares owned by each



Budgets or projections, for a minimum of five years



Information about the company's industry and economic environment



List of major customers by sales



Organisation chart and management roles and responsibilities



Profit forecasts or budgets

This list is not exhaustive and there are limitations to some of the information. For example, statement of
financial position values of assets may be out of date and unrealistic, projections may be unduly optimistic
or pessimistic and much of the information used in business valuation is subjective. We will look at this in
more detail under each valuation method.

Exam focus
point

In an exam question as well as in practice, it is unlikely that one method would be used in isolation.
Several valuations might be made, each using a different technique or different assumptions. The
valuations could then be compared, and a final price reached as a compromise between the different
values. Remember that some methods may be more appropriate for valuing a small parcel of shares,
others for valuing a whole company.
You may find it useful to read the article titled 'Business valuations' which is available on the ACCA
website. It can be found at:

1.4 Market capitalisation
Key term

12/16

Market capitalisation is the market value of a company's shares. This is the share price multiplied by the
number of issued shares.
For quoted companies, calculating the market capitalisation of its shares is therefore a straightforward
process.
However, if the shares of the company do not have a liquid secondary market, its quoted market price may
not be a fair reflection of value. In these cases, where a valuation of the business is required, other
methods of valuation in addition to market capitalisation may be worth making to assess whether the
market capitalisation seems reasonable.

Exam focus
point

In June 2008, the ACCA examining team used the term 'market capitalisation' to ask for a calculation of
the value of a company. Some students were confused by this terminology.

2 Asset valuation bases
FAST FORWARD

The net assets valuation method can be used as one of many valuation methods, or to provide a lower
limit for the value of a company. By itself it is unlikely to produce the most realistic value.

2.1 Net assets method of share valuation
Exam focus
point

6/15, 9/16

In the December 2011 exam, many candidates struggled to calculate the net asset value of a company
based on a set of financial statements. There should be fairly easy marks so make sure you can do this.
Using this method of valuation, the value of an equity share is equal to the net tangible assets divided by
the number of shares.
Net tangible assets are the value in the statement of financial position of the tangible non-current assets
(net of depreciation) plus current assets, minus all liabilities.
Intangible assets (including goodwill) should be excluded, unless they have a market value (for example
patents and copyrights, which could be sold).

17: Business valuations

Part F Business valuations

(a)

Goodwill, if shown in the financial statements, is unlikely to be shown at a true figure for purposes
of valuation, and the value of goodwill should be reflected in another method of valuation (for
example the earnings basis).

(b)

Development expenditure, if shown in the financial statements, would also have a value which is
related to future profits rather than to the worth of the company's physical assets.

2.3 Choice of valuation bases
The difficulty in an asset valuation method is establishing the asset values to use. Values ought to be
realistic. The figure attached to an individual asset may vary considerably depending on whether it is
valued on a going concern or a break-up basis.
Possibilities include:


Historical cost basis (net book value) – unlikely to give a realistic value, as it is dependent on the
business's depreciation and amortisation policy.



Realisable basis – if the assets are to be sold, or the business as a whole broken up. This won't be
relevant if a minority (non-controlling) shareholder is selling their stake, as the assets will continue
in the business's use.



Replacement basis – if the assets are to be used on an ongoing basis.

The following list should give you some idea of the factors that must be considered.
(a)

Do the assets need professional valuation? If so, how much will this cost?

(b)

Have the liabilities been accurately quantified, for example deferred taxation? Are there any
contingent liabilities? Will any balancing tax charges arise on disposal?

(c)

How have the current assets been valued? Are all receivables collectable? Is all inventory
realisable? Can all the assets be physically located and brought into a saleable condition? This may
be difficult in certain circumstances where the assets are situated abroad.

(d)

Can any hidden liabilities be accurately assessed? Would there be redundancy payments and
closure costs?

(e)

Is there an available market in which the assets can be realised (on a break-up basis)? If so, do
the statement of financial position values truly reflect these break-up values?

(f)

Are there any prior charges on the assets?

(g)

Does the business have a regular revaluation and replacement policy? What are the bases of the
valuation? As a broad rule, valuations will be more useful the better they estimate the future cash
flows that are derived from the asset.

(h)

Are there factors that might indicate that the going concern valuation of the business as a whole
is significantly higher than the valuation of the individual assets?

(i)

What shareholdings are being sold? If a non-controlling interest is being disposed of, realisable
value is of limited relevance, as the assets will not be sold.

2.4 Use of net asset basis
The net assets basis of valuation might be used in the following circumstances.
(a)

As a measure of the 'security' in a share value. A share might be valued using an earnings basis.
This valuation might be higher or lower than the net asset value per share. If the earnings basis
is higher, then if the company went into liquidation, the investor could not expect to receive the full
value of their shares when the underlying assets were realised.
The asset backing for shares thus provides a measure of the possible loss if the company fails to
make the expected earnings or dividend payments. Valuable tangible assets may be a good reason
for acquiring a company, especially freehold property which might be expected to increase in value
over time.

(b)

Key term

352

As a measure of comparison in a scheme of merger

A merger is essentially a business combination of two or more companies, of which none obtains control
over any other.

17: Business valuations

Part F Business valuations
w


For example, if company A, which has a low asset backing, is planning a merger with company B,
which has a high asset backing, the shareholders of B might consider that their shares' value ought
to reflect this. It might therefore be agreed that something should be added to the value of the
company B shares to allow for this difference in asset backing.
(c)

As a 'floor value' for a business that is up for sale. Shareholders will be reluctant to sell for less
than the NAV. However, if the sale is essential for cash flow purposes or to realign with corporate
strategy, even the asset value may not be realised.

For these reasons, it is always advisable to calculate the net assets per share.

3 Income-based valuation bases
FAST FORWARD

P/E ratios may be used to value equity shares when a large block of shares, or a whole business, is being
valued. This method can be problematic when P/E ratios for quoted companies are used to value unquoted
companies.

3.1 P/E ratio (earnings) method of valuation
12/14, 12/16
A P/E ratio-based valuation of equity shares may be used to value a controlling interest in the shares of a
company, where the owner can decide on dividend and retentions policy. The P/E ratio relates earnings
per share to a share's value.
Since P/E ratio =

Market value
,
EPS

then market value per share = EPS

Exam focus
point

P/E ratio

Remember that earnings per share (EPS) =

Profit/loss attributable to ordinary shareholders
Weighted average number of ordinary shares

The ACCA examining team has commented in the past that students often calculate earnings per share
incorrectly.
The P/E ratio produces an earnings-based valuation of shares by deciding a suitable P/E ratio and
multiplying this by the EPS for the shares which are being valued.
Market valuation or capitalisation =

(for individual shares) P/E ratio

Earnings per share, or

(for all the company's equity) P/E ratio

Total earnings

The EPS could be a historical EPS or a prospective future EPS. For a given EPS figure, a higher P/E ratio
will result in a higher price.

3.2 Significance of high P/E ratio
A high P/E ratio may indicate:
(a)

Expectations that the EPS will grow rapidly

A high price is being paid for future profit prospects. Many small but successful and fast-growing
companies are valued on the stock market on a high P/E ratio. Some stocks (for example those of
some software companies in the 2010s) have reached high valuations before making any profits at
all, on the strength of expected future earnings.
(b)

Security of earnings

A well-established low-risk company would be valued on a higher P/E ratio than a similar company
whose earnings are subject to greater uncertainty.
Part F
w

Business valuations

17: Business valuations

353

(c)

Status

If a quoted company (the bidder) made a share for share takeover bid for an unquoted company
(the target), it would normally expect its own shares to be valued on a higher P/E ratio than the
target company's shares. This is because a quoted company ought to be a lower-risk company; but
in addition, there is an advantage in having shares which are quoted on a stock market: the shares
can be readily sold. The P/E ratio of an unquoted company's shares might be around 50% to 60%
of the P/E ratio of a similar public company with a full stock market listing.

3.3 Problems with using P/E ratios
However, using the P/E ratios of quoted companies to value unquoted companies may be problematic.
This is because a P/E ratio must be guessed at, using the P/E ratios for similar quoted companies as a
guide.


Finding a quoted company with a similar range of activities may be difficult. Quoted companies
are often diversified.



A single year's P/E ratio may not be a good basis if earnings are volatile, or the quoted company's
share price is at an abnormal level, due for example to the expectation of a takeover bid.



If a P/E ratio trend is used, then historical data will be used to value how the unquoted company
will do in the future.



The quoted company may have a different capital structure to the unquoted company.

3.4 Guidelines for a P/E ratio-based valuation
When a company is thinking of acquiring an unquoted company in a takeover, the final offer price will be
agreed by negotiation, but a list of some of the factors affecting the valuer's choice of P/E ratio is given
below.
(a)

The general economic and financial conditions will have an impact.

(b)

The type of industry and the prospects of that industry. Use of current P/E ratios may give an
unrealistically low valuation if these ratios are being affected by a lack of confidence throughout the
industry.

(c)

The size of the undertaking and its status within its industry. If an unquoted company's earnings
are growing annually, then it could probably seek a listing in its own right, and a higher P/E ratio
should therefore be used when valuing its shares.

(d)

Marketability. The market in shares which do not have a stock market quotation is always a
restricted one (ie it is harder to find a buyer for these shares) and a lower P/E ratio may therefore
be appropriate (around a half to two-thirds of the P/E ratio for a similar quoted company).

(e)

The reliability of profit estimates and the past profit record.

(f)

Asset backing and liquidity are both factors.

(g)

The nature of the assets will be considered, for example whether some of the non-current assets
are of a highly specialised nature, and so have only a small break-up value.

(h)

Gearing. A relatively high gearing ratio will generally mean greater financial risk for ordinary
shareholders and call for a higher rate of return on equity.

(i)

The extent to which the business is dependent on the technical skills of one or more individuals
will be considered.

3.4.1 Use of a bidder's P/E ratio
A bidder company may sometimes use its higher P/E ratio to value a target company. This assumes that
the bidder can improve the target's business, which may be a dangerous assumption to make. It may be
better to use an adjusted industry P/E ratio, or some other method.

354

3.4.2 Use of forecast earnings
When one company is thinking about taking over another, it should look at the target company's forecast
earnings, not just its historical results.

Exam focus
point

Make sure the earnings you use are future maintainable earnings. One-off income or expenses should be
excluded.
Forecasts of earnings growth should only be used if:
(a)

There are good reasons to believe that earnings growth will be achieved.

(b)

A reasonable estimate of growth can be made.

(c)

Forecasts supplied by the target company's directors are made in good faith and using reasonable
assumptions and fair accounting policies.

Question

Flycatcher wishes to make a takeover bid for the shares of an unquoted company, Mayfly. The earnings of
Mayfly over the past five years have been as follows.
20X0
20X1
20X2

$50,000
$72,000
$68,000

20X3
20X4

$71,000
$75,000

The average P/E ratio of quoted companies in the industry in which Mayfly operates is 10. Quoted
companies which are similar in many respects to Mayfly are:
(a)
(b)

Bumblebee, which has a P/E ratio of 15, but is a company with very good growth prospects
Wasp, which has had a poor profit record for several years, and has a P/E ratio of 7

What would be a suitable range of valuations for the shares of Mayfly?

Answer
(a)

Earnings. Average earnings over the last five years have been $67,200, and over the last four years
$71,500. There might appear to be some growth prospects, but estimates of future earnings are
uncertain.

A low estimate of earnings in 20X5 would be, perhaps, $71,500.
A high estimate of earnings might be $75,000 or more. This solution will use the most recent
earnings figure of $75,000 as the high estimate.
(b)

P/E ratio. A P/E ratio of 15 (Bumblebee's) would be much too high for Mayfly, because the growth
of Mayfly earnings is not as certain, and Mayfly is an unquoted company.

On the other hand, Mayfly's expectations of earnings are probably better than those of Wasp. A
suitable P/E ratio might be based on the industry's average, 10; but since Mayfly is an unquoted
company and therefore more risky, a lower P/E ratio might be more appropriate: perhaps 60% to
70% of 10 = 6 or 7, or conceivably even as low as 50% of 10 = 5.
The valuation of Mayfly's shares might therefore range between:
high P/E ratio and high earnings: 7 $75,000 = $525,000; and
low P/E ratio and low earnings: 5 $71,500 = $357,500.

3.5 Earnings yield valuation method

6/15, 12/16

Another income-based valuation model is the earnings yield method.
Earnings yield (EY) =

EPS
Market price per share

100%

This method is effectively a variation on the P/E method because EY is EPS divided by the share price and
P/E is the share price divided by EPS (so the EY is the reciprocal of the P/E ratio).
So market value can now be calculated as:
Market value =

Earnings
EY

In the previous question, a possible P/E ratio for Mayfly was 5. This P/E ratio would give an earnings yield
of 1/5 = 0.2 or 20%. The market value of Mayfly's shares can therefore be calculated as earnings divided
by earnings yield ie $71,500/0.2 = $357,500. This is the same value obtained by the P/E method when
applying a P/E ratio of 5.

4 Cash flow based valuation models
FAST FORWARD

Cash flow based valuation models include the dividend valuation model, the dividend growth model and
valuation on a discounted cash flow basis.

4.1 Dividend valuation model
The dividend valuation model is based on the theory that an equilibrium price for any share (or loan note)
on a stock market is:



The future expected stream of income from the security
Discounted at a suitable cost of capital

Equilibrium market price is thus a present value of a future expected income stream. The annual income
stream for a share is the expected dividend every year in perpetuity.
The basic dividend-based formula for the market value of shares is expressed in the dividend valuation
model as follows.
MV (ex div) =
where

D
1 ke

D

D
2

(1 k e )

3

(1 k e )

...

D
ke

MV = Ex-dividend market value of the shares
D = Constant annual dividend
ke = Shareholders' required rate of return

This should look familiar. We used the dividend valuation model in Chapter 14 to calculate a cost of equity,
given the annual dividend and share price.
Here the same model is used to calculate a share price, given the annual dividend and the cost of equity.
For example, if a company is expected to pay an annual dividend of $0.50 per share on its equity shares
into the foreseeable future, and the cost of equity is 8%, the market value of the share would be
$0.50/0.08 = $6.25.

In Chapter 14, we used this model to calculate a cost of equity, given the share price, the current annual
dividend and expectations of future dividend growth. Here, we calculate a market value per share, given
the current annual dividend, expectations of future dividend growth and a cost of equity.

4.3 Assumptions in the dividend valuation model
The dividend valuation model is underpinned by a number of assumptions that you should bear in mind.
(a)

Investors act rationally and homogenously. The model fails to take into account the different
expectations of shareholders, or how much they are motivated by a preference for dividends over
future capital appreciation on their shares.

(b)

The current year's dividend (D0 figure) does not vary significantly from the trend of dividends. If
D0 does appear to be a rogue figure, it may be better to use an adjusted trend figure, calculated on
the basis of the past few years' dividends.

(c)

The estimates of future dividends and prices used and also the cost of capital are reasonable. As
with other methods, it may be difficult to make a confident estimate of the cost of capital. Dividend
estimates may be made from historical trends that may not be a good guide for a future, or derived
from uncertain forecasts about future earnings.

(d)

Investors' attitudes to receiving different cash flows at different times can be modelled using
discounted cash flow arithmetic.

(e)

Directors use dividends to signal the strength of the company's position. (However, companies
that pay zero dividends do not have zero share values.)

(f)

Dividends either show no growth or constant growth. If the growth rate is estimated using
Gordon's growth approximation (g = br), then the model assumes that the percentage of profits
retained in the business and the return on those retained profits, b and r, are constant values.

(g)

Other influences on share prices are ignored.

(h)

The company's earnings will increase sufficiently to maintain dividend growth levels.

(i)

The discount rate used exceeds the dividend growth rate.

4.4 Discounted cash flow basis of valuation

9/16

A DCF method of share valuation may be appropriate when one company intends to buy the assets of
another company and to make further improvements to boost cash flows in the future (ie synergies will be
created).
The steps in this method of valuation are:

Step 1

Estimate the cash flows that will be obtained each year from the acquired business. The cash
flows may be estimated for a maximum number of years (say, for ten years). Alternatively,
there may be an assumption about annual cash flows from the business into perpetuity.

Step 2

Discount these cash flows at an appropriate cost of capital.
If the cash flows are after interest payments on the debt of the target company, and after tax,
then these cash flows represent the returns to ordinary shareholders and are discounted at
the cost of equity to calculate the present value of the equity (ie ordinary) shares.

358

17: Business valuations

Part F Business valuations
w


If the cash flows are before interest then they represent the returns to all investors (whether
debtholders or shareholders) and so should be discounted at the overall weighted average
cost of capital to calculate the present value of the company (ie ordinary shares plus debt).
This value will be used if a valuation of the whole company is needed (for example if the
proposal is to buy the entire business, both the shares and the debt). If only the equity needs
to be valued then the value of debt will then need to be deducted to calculate the value of
equity.

4.4.1 Example: Discounted future cash flows method of share valuation
Diversification wishes to make a bid for Tadpole. Tadpole makes after-tax profits of $40,000 a year.
Diversification believes that if further money is spent on additional investments, the after-tax (and interest)
cash flows (ignoring the purchase consideration) could be as follows.

interest)

The cost of equity of Diversification is 15% and the company expects all its investments to pay back, in
discounted terms, within five years.
(a)

What is the maximum price that the company should be willing to pay for the shares of Tadpole?

(b)

What is the maximum price that the company should be willing to pay for the shares of Tadpole if it
decides to value the business on the basis of its cash flows in perpetuity, and annual cash flows
from Year 6 onwards are expected to be $120,000?

Solution
(a)

The maximum price is one which would make the return from the total investment exactly 15%
over five years, so that the NPV at 15% would be 0. It is suitable to use the cost of equity because
the cash flows are after interest.

If the shares are valued on the basis of cash flows in perpetuity, we need to add the PV of annual
cash flows from Year 6 onwards.
The value of the cash flows from Year 6 onwards, in perpetuity, at a Year 5 present value =
$120,000/0.15 = $800,000.
Discounting this to a Year 0 PV: $800,000 × 0.497 = $397,600.
This increases the valuation from $101,910 to $499,510.
The difference between this valuation and the valuation in (a) is huge. It may illustrate that business
valuations depend crucially on the assumptions that are used to reach the valuation.

4.4.2 Selection of an appropriate cost of capital
In the above example, Diversification used its own cost of capital to discount the cash flows of Tadpole.
There are a number of reasons why this may not be appropriate.
(a)

The business risk of the new investment may not match that of the investing company. If Tadpole
is in a completely different line of business from Diversification, its cash flows are likely to be
subject to differing degrees of risk, and this should be taken into account when valuing them.

(b)

The method of finance of the new investment may not match the current debt/equity mix of the
investing company, which may have an effect on the cost of capital to be used.

Question

Valuation methods

Profed provides a tuition service for professional students. This includes courses of lectures provided on
their own premises and provision of study material for home study. Most of the lecturers are qualified
professionals with many years' experience in both their profession and tuition. Study materials are written
and word processed in-house, but sent out to an external printers.
The business was started 15 years ago, and now employs around 40 full-time lecturers, 10 authors and 20
support staff. Freelance lecturers and authors are employed from time to time in times of peak demand.
The shareholders of Profed mainly comprise the original founders of the business who would now like to
realise their investment. In order to arrive at an estimate of what they believe the business to be worth,
they have identified a long-established quoted company, City Tutors, who have a similar business,
although they also publish texts for external sale to universities, colleges, etc.
Summary financial statistics for the two companies for the most recent financial year are as follows.

The net assets of Profed are the net book values of tangible non-current assets plus net working
capital. However:



A recent valuation of the buildings was $1.5m above book value.



Inventory includes past editions of textbooks which have a realisable value of $100,000
below their cost.



Due to a dispute with one of their clients, an additional allowance for bad debts of $750,000
could prudently be made.

Growth rates should be assumed to be constant per annum; Profed's earnings growth rate
estimate was provided by the marketing manager, based on expected growth in sales adjusted by
normal profit margins. City Tutors' growth rates were gleaned from press reports.

$0.35 = $6.34 per share, a total valuation of $25.4m.

Dividend valuation model

The dividend valuation method gives the share price as:
Next year's dividend
Cost of equity Growth rate
which assumes dividends being paid into perpetuity, and growth at a constant rate.
For Profed, next year's dividend = $0.20

1.09 = $0.218 per share

We can use the information for City Tutors to estimate a cost of equity for Profed. This is assuming
the business risks to be similar, and ignoring the small difference in their gearing ratio.
Again, from the DVM, cost of equity =
For City Tutors, cost of equity =

next year's dividend
+ growth rate
market price

$0.18 1.075
+ 0.075 = 12.84%
$3.62

Using, say, 13% as a cost of equity for Profed (it could be argued that this should be higher since
Profed is unquoted so riskier than the quoted City Tutors):
Share price =

$0.218
= $5.45
0.13 0.09

This values the whole of the share capital at $21.8m.

Comment on relative merits of the methods used, and their suitability
Asset-based valuation

Valuing a company on the basis of its asset values alone is rarely appropriate if it is to be sold on
a going concern basis. Exceptions would include property investment companies and investment
trusts, the market values of the assets of which will bear a close relationship to their earning
capacities.
Profed is typical of a lot of service companies, a large part of whose value lies in the skill,
knowledge and reputation of its personnel. This is not reflected in the net asset values, and
renders this method quite inappropriate. A potential purchaser of Profed will generally value its
intangible assets, such as knowledge, expertise, customer/supplier relationships and brands, more
highly than those that can be measured in accounting terms.
Knowledge of the net asset value (NAV) of a company will, however, be important as a floor value
for a company which is in financial difficulties or subject to a takeover bid. Shareholders will be
reluctant to sell for less than the NAV even if future prospects are poor.
P/E ratio valuation

The P/E ratio measures the multiple of the current year's earnings that is reflected in the market
price of a share. It is thus a method that reflects the earnings potential of a company from a market
point of view. Provided the marketing is efficient, it is likely to give the most meaningful basis for
valuation.
One of the first things to say is that the market price of a share at any point in time is determined
by supply and demand forces prevalent during small transactions, and will be dependent on a lot of
factors in addition to a realistic appraisal of future prospects. A downturn in the market economies
and political changes can all affect the day to day price of a share and thus its prevailing P/E ratio.
It is not known whether the share price given for City Tutors was taken on one particular day, or
was some sort of average over a period. The latter would perhaps give a sounder basis from which
to compute an applicable P/E ratio.
Even if the P/E ratio of City Tutors can be taken to be indicative of its true worth, using it as a
basis to value a smaller, unquoted company in the same industry can be problematic.
The P/E for City Tours is18.1. This will take account of such factors as marketability of shares,
status of company and growth potential that will differ from those for Profed. However, all other
things being equal, the P/E ratio for an unquoted company should be taken as between one-half to
two-thirds of that of an equivalent quoted company. Being generous, in view of the possible higher
growth prospects of Profed, we might estimate an appropriate P/E ratio of around 12, assuming
that Profed is to remain a private company.
Profed's growth rate has been estimated as higher than that of City Tutors, possibly because it is a
younger, developing company, although the basis for the estimate may be questionable.
Dividend-based valuation

The dividend valuation model (DVM) is a cash flow based approach, which values the dividends
that the shareholders expect to receive from the company by discounting them at their required
rate of return. It is perhaps more appropriate for valuing a non-controlling shareholding where the
holder has no influence over the level of dividends to be paid than for valuing a whole company,
where the total cash flows will be of greater relevance.
The practical problems with the dividend valuation model lie mainly in its assumptions. Even
accepting that the required 'perfect capital market' assumptions may be satisfied to some extent, in
reality the formula used in (a) assumes constant growth rates and constant required rates of return
in perpetuity.
Determination of an appropriate cost of equity is particularly difficult for a unquoted company, and
the use of an 'equivalent' quoted company's data carries the same drawbacks as discussed above.

Similar problems arise in estimating future growth rates, and the results from the model are highly
sensitive to changes in both these inputs.
It is also highly dependent on the current year's dividend being a representative base from which
to start.

5 Valuation of debt

12/14, 6/15, Mar/Jun 16, 9/16

In Chapter 14, we looked at how to calculate the cost of debt and other financial assets. The same
formulae can be rearranged so that we can calculate their value.
FAST FORWARD

For irredeemable debt:
Market price, ex interest (P0) =
=

I
Kd

i (1 T) with tax
K dnet

For redeemable debt, the market value is the discounted present value of future interest receivable, up
to the year of redemption, plus the discounted present value of the redemption payment.

5.1 Debt calculations – a few notes
(a)

Debt is always quoted in $100 nominal units, or blocks; always use $100 nominal values as the
basis to your calculations.

(b)

Debt can be quoted as a percentage or as a value, eg 97% or $97. Both mean that $100 nominal
value of debt is worth $97 market value.

(c)

Interest on debt is stated as a percentage of nominal value. This is known as the coupon rate. It is
not the same as the redemption yield on debt or the cost of debt.

(d)

The ACCA examining team sometimes quotes an interest yield, defined as coupon/market price.

(e)

Always use ex-interest prices in any calculations.

5.2 Irredeemable debt
For irredeemable loan notes where the company will go on paying interest every year in perpetuity,
without ever having to redeem the loan (ignoring taxation):

P0 =

i

where

P0 is the market price of the loan note ex interest; that is, excluding any interest payment that

For example, if the cost of debt is 7% before tax and 5.6% after tax, and the rate of tax is 20%, the market
value of irredeemable debt with a coupon rate of 6% will be:
P0 = 6/0.07 = 85.71, or
P0 = 6(1 – 0.20)/0.056 = 85.71
Both formulae produce the same valuation.

5.3 Redeemable debt
The valuation of redeemable debt spends on future expected receipts. The market value is the discounted
present value of future interest receivable, up to the year of redemption, plus the discounted present value
of the redemption payment.

Formula to
learn

Value of debt = (Interest earnings

annuity factor) + (Redemption value

Discounted cash flow factor)

5.4 Example: Valuation of debt
Furry has in issue 12% loan notes with par value $100,000 and redemption value $110,000, with interest
payable quarterly. The cost of debt on the loan notes is 8% annually and 2% quarterly. The loan notes are
redeemable on 30 June 20X4 and it is now 31 December 20X0.
Required

Calculate the market value of the loan notes.

Solution
You need to use the cost of debt as the discount rate, and remember to use an annuity factor for the
interest. We are discounting over 14 periods (quarters) using the quarterly discount rate (8%/4).

5.5 Convertible debt
Convertible loan notes were discussed in Section 2 of Chapter 12. As a reminder, when convertible loan
notes are traded on a stock market, its minimum market price will be the price of straight loan notes with
the same coupon rate of interest. If the market value falls to this minimum, it follows that the market
attaches no value to the conversion rights.
The actual market price of convertible loan notes will depend on:





The price of straight debt
The current conversion value
The length of time before conversion may take place
The market's expectation as to future equity returns and the associated risk

If the conversion value rises above the straight debt value then the price of convertible loan notes will
normally reflect this increase.

Formula to
learn

Conversion value = P0 (1 + g)nR

where

P0
g
n
R

is the current ex-dividend ordinary share price
is the expected annual growth of the ordinary share price
is the number of years to conversion
is the number of shares received on conversion

The current market value of a convertible loan note where conversion is expected is the sum of the
present values of the future interest payments and the present value of the loan note's conversion value.

5.6 Example: Valuation of convertible debt
What is the value of a 9% convertible loan note if it can be converted in 5 years' time into 35 ordinary
shares or redeemed at par on the same date? An investor's required return is 10% and the current market
price of the underlying share is $2.50 which is expected to grow by 4% per annum.

Solution
Conversion value = P0 (1 + g)nR = 2.50

1.045

35 = $106.46

Present value of $9 interest per annum for 5 years at 10% = 9
Present value of the conversion value = 106.46

3.791 = $34.12

0.621 = $66.11

Current market value of convertible loan note = 34.12 + 66.11 = $100.23

company. It makes sense to use several methods of valuation, and to compare the values they produce.



The net assets valuation method can be used as one of many valuation methods, or to provide a lower
limit for the value of a company. By itself it is unlikely to produce the most realistic value.



P/E ratios may be used to value equity shares when a large block of shares, or a whole business, is being
valued. This method can be problematic when P/E ratios for quoted companies are used to value unquoted
companies.

Exam guide
Market efficiency may need to be discussed as part of a business valuation question.

1 The efficient market hypothesis
FAST FORWARD

The theory behind share price movements can be explained by the three forms of the efficient market
hypothesis.
–
–
–

Key term

Sep/Dec 15, 9/16, 12/16

Weak form efficiency implies that prices reflect all relevant information about past price
movements and their implications.
Semi-strong form efficiency implies that prices reflect past price movements and publicly available
knowledge.
Strong form efficiency implies that prices reflect past price movements, publicly available
knowledge and inside knowledge.

The efficient market hypothesis provides a rationale for explaining how share prices react to new
information about a company, and when any such change in share price occurs. Stock market reaction to
new information depends on the strength of the stock market efficiency.

1.1 Definition of market efficiency
Different types of efficiency can be distinguished in the context of the operation of financial markets.
(a)

Allocative efficiency
If financial markets allow funds to be directed towards firms which make the most productive use
of them, then there is allocative efficiency in these markets.

(b)

Operational efficiency
Transaction costs are incurred by participants in financial markets, for example commissions on
share transactions, margins between interest rates for lending and for borrowing, and loan
arrangement fees. Financial markets have operational efficiency if transaction costs are kept as
low as possible. Transaction costs are kept low where there is open competition between brokers
and other market participants.

370

18: Market efficiency

Part F Business valuations
w


(c)

Information processing efficiency
The information processing efficiency of a stock market means the ability of a stock market to
price stocks and shares fairly and quickly. An efficient market in this sense is one in which the
market prices of all securities reflect all the available information.

The efficient markets hypothesis is concerned with the information processing efficiency of stock markets.

1.2 Varying degrees of efficiency
There are three degrees or 'forms' of stock market efficiency: weak form, semi-strong form and strong
form.

1.2.1 Weak form efficiency
If a stock market has weak form efficiency, it is not efficient at responding to events that affect companies
and should affect share prices. It does not react to much of the information that is available about a
company. Instead, when stock market efficiency is weak, share prices only reflect historical information
including information about past share price movements.
If stock markets exhibit weak-form efficiency, investors can't make excess profits by studying past share
price movements (an approach that is sometimes called technical analysis).

1.2.2 Semi-strong form efficiency
If a stock market displays semi-strong efficiency, current share prices reflect:



All relevant information about past price movements and their implications
All publicly available knowledge about companies and market returns

Share prices respond quickly to new information as it becomes available.
This means that individuals cannot 'beat the market' by reading the newspapers or annual reports, since
the information contained in these will already be reflected in share prices.
Tests to prove semi-strong efficiency have concentrated on the speed and accuracy of stock market
response to information and on the ability of the market to anticipate share price changes before new
information is formally announced. For example, if two companies plan a merger, share prices of the two
companies will inevitably change once the merger plans are formally announced. The market would show
semi-strong efficiency, however, if it were able to anticipate such an announcement, so that share prices
of the companies concerned would change in advance of the merger plans being confirmed.
Research in both the UK and the US has suggested that market prices anticipate mergers several months
before they are formally announced, and the conclusion drawn is that the stock markets in these countries
do exhibit semi-strong efficiency.

1.2.3 Strong form efficiency
If a stock market displays a strong form of efficiency, share prices reflect all information, whether it is
publicly available or not:




From past price changes
From public knowledge or anticipation
From specialists' or experts' insider knowledge (eg the inside knowledge of investment managers
about unpublished facts)

If a stock market has strong form efficiency, share prices will respond to new developments and events
before they even become public knowledge.

1.3 Features of efficient markets
Stock markets that are efficient (or semi-efficient) are therefore markets in which:
(a)

The prices of securities bought and sold reflect all the relevant information available to the buyers
and sellers, and share prices change quickly to reflect all new information about future prospects.

(b)

No individual dominates the market.

(c)

Transaction costs of buying and selling are not so high as to discourage trading significantly.

(d)

Investors are rational and so make rational buying and selling decisions, and value shares in a
rational way.

(e)

There are low, or no, costs of acquiring information.

1.4 Impact of efficiency on share prices
If the stock market is efficient, share prices should vary in a rational way.
(a)

If a company makes an investment with a positive net present value (NPV), shareholders will get
to know about it and the market price of its shares will rise in anticipation of future dividend
increases.

(b)

If a company makes a bad investment, shareholders will find out and so the price of its shares
will fall.

(c)

If interest rates rise, shareholders will want a higher return from their investments, so market
prices will fall.

1.5 Implications of efficient market hypothesis for the financial
manager
If the markets are quite strongly efficient, the main consequence for financial managers will be that they
simply need to concentrate on maximising the net present value of the company's investments in order
to maximise the wealth of shareholders. Managers need not worry, for example, about the effect on share
prices of financial results in the published accounts because investors will make allowances for low
profits or dividends in the current year if higher profits or dividends are expected in the future.
If the market is strongly efficient, there is little point in financial managers attempting strategies that will
attempt to mislead the markets.
(a)

There is no point for example in trying to identify a correct date when shares should be issued,
since share prices will always reflect the true worth of the company.

(b)

The market will identify any attempts to window dress the accounts and put an optimistic spin on
the figures.

(c)

The market will decide what level of return it requires for the risk involved in making an investment
in the company. It is pointless for the company to try to change the market's view by issuing
different types of capital instruments.

Similarly, if the company is looking to expand, the directors will be wasting their time if they seek as
takeover targets companies whose shares are undervalued, since the market will fairly value all
companies' shares.
Only if the market is semi-strongly efficient, and the financial managers possess inside information that
would significantly alter the price of the company's shares if released to the market, could they perhaps
gain an advantage. However, attempts to take account of this inside information may breach insider
dealing laws.
The different characteristics of a semi-strong form and a strong form efficient market thus affect the
timing of share price movements, in cases where the relevant information becomes available to the
market eventually. The difference between the two forms of market efficiency concerns when the share
prices change, not by how much prices eventually change.

Exam focus
point

The point that share prices may depend to some extent on the efficiency of the markets is important when
you discuss company valuations.

2 The valuation of shares
FAST FORWARD

Fundamental analysis is based on the theory that share prices can be derived from a rational analysis of
future dividends.
Technical analysts or chartists work on the basis that past price patterns will be repeated, therefore
future price movements can be predicted from historical patterns of share price movements in the past,
and there are some patterns that continually reappear.
Random walk theory is based on the idea that share prices will alter when new information becomes
available.
Share prices are also affected by marketability and liquidity of shares, availability and sources of
information, market imperfections and pricing anomalies, market capitalisation and investor speculation.

2.1 The fundamental theory of share values
We discussed the fundamental theory of share values in the last chapter. Remember that it is based on the
theory that the realistic market price of a share can be derived from a valuation of estimated future
dividends. The value of a share will be the discounted present value of all future expected dividends on the
shares, discounted at the shareholders' cost of capital. The theory therefore supports the view that
'realistic' share prices can be determined by valuation models, such as the dividend growth model.
If the fundamental analysis theory of share values is correct, the price of any share will be predictable,
provided that all investors have the same information about a company's expected future profits and
dividends, and a known cost of capital.

2.2 Charting or technical analysis
Chartists or 'technical analysts' attempt to predict share price movements by assuming that past price
patterns will be repeated. There is no real theoretical justification for this approach, but it can at times be
spectacularly successful. Studies have suggested that the degree of success is greater than could be
expected merely from chance.

Chartists do not attempt to predict every price change. They are primarily interested in trend reversals, for
example when the price of a share has been rising for several months but suddenly starts to fall.
Moving averages help the chartist to examine overall trends. For example, they may calculate and plot
moving averages of share prices for 20 days, 60 days and 240 days. The 20 day figures will give a
reasonable representation of the actual movement in share prices after eliminating day to day fluctuations.
The other two moving averages give a good idea of longer-term trends.
One of the main problems with chartism is that it is often difficult to see a new trend until after it has
happened. By the time the chartist has detected a signal, other chartists will have as well, and the
resulting mass movement to buy or sell will push the price so as to eliminate any advantage.
With the use of sophisticated computer programs to simulate the work of a chartist, academic studies
have found that the results obtained were no better or worse than those obtained from a simple 'buy and
hold' strategy of a well-diversified portfolio of shares.
This may be explained by research that has found that there are no regular patterns or cycles in share
price movements over time – they follow a random walk.

2.3 Random walk theory

12/16

Random walk theory is consistent with the fundamental theory of share values. It accepts that a share
should have an intrinsic price dependent on the fortunes of the company and the expectations of
investors. One of its underlying assumptions is that all relevant information about a company is
available to all potential investors who will act on the information in a rational manner.

The key feature of random walk theory is that, although share prices will have an intrinsic or fundamental
value, this value will be altered as new information becomes available, and that the behaviour of investors
is such that the actual share price will fluctuate from day to day around the intrinsic value.

2.4 Marketability and liquidity of shares
In financial markets, liquidity is the ease of dealing in the shares; how easily the shares can be bought
and sold without significantly moving the price.
In general, large companies, with hundreds of millions of shares in issue, and high numbers of shares
changing hands every day, have good liquidity. In contrast, small companies with few shares in issue and
thin trading volumes can have very poor liquidity.
The marketability of shares in a private company, particularly a minority shareholding, is generally very
limited, a consequence being that the price can be difficult to determine.
Shares with restricted marketability may be subject to sudden and large falls in value and companies may
act to improve the marketability of their shares with a stock split. A stock split occurs where, for example,
each ordinary share of $1 each is split into two shares of 50c each, thus creating cheaper shares with
greater marketability. There is possibly an added psychological advantage in that investors may expect a
company which splits its shares in this way to be planning for substantial earnings growth and dividend
growth in the future.
As a consequence, the market price of shares may benefit. For example, if one existing share of $1 has a
market value of $6, and is then split into two shares of 50c each, the market value of the new shares might
settle at, say, $3.10 instead of the expected $3, in anticipation of strong future growth in earnings and
dividends.

2.5 Availability and sources of information
In Section 1 of this chapter it was stated that an efficient market is one where the prices of securities
bought and sold reflect all the relevant information available. Efficiency relates to how quickly and how
accurately prices adjust to new information.
Information comes from financial statements, financial databases, the financial press and the internet.

2.5.1 Dividend information
It has been argued that shareholders see dividend decisions as passing on new information about the
company and its prospects. A dividend increase is usually seen by markets to be good news and a
dividend decrease to be bad news, but it may be that the market will react to the difference between the
actual dividend payments and the market's expectations of the level of dividend. For example, the market
may be expecting a cut in dividend but if the actual decrease is less than expected, the share price may rise.

2.6 Market imperfections and pricing anomalies
Various types of anomaly appear to support the views that irrationality often drives the stock market,
including the following.
(a)

Seasonal month of the year effects, day of the week effects and also hour of the day effects seem
to occur, so that share prices might tend to rise or fall at a particular time of the year, week or day.

(b)

There may be a short-run overreaction to recent events. For example, during the stock market
crash in 1987, the market went into free fall, losing 20% in a few hours.

(c)

Individual shares or shares in small companies may be neglected.

The paradox of efficient markets is that an efficient market requires people to believe that the market is
inefficient so that they trade securities in an attempt to outperform the market.
A noise trader is a trader who buys and sells irrationally and erratically; for example, overreacting to good
or bad news. Noise traders can cause prices and risk levels to change from expected levels.

2.7 Market capitalisation
The market capitalisation is the market value of a company's shares multiplied by the number of issued
shares.
The market capitalisation or size of a company has also produced some pricing anomalies.
The return from investing in smaller companies has been shown to be greater than the average return
from all companies in the long run. This increased return may compensate for the greater risk associated
with smaller companies, or it may be due to a start from a lower base.

2.8 Behavioural finance
Speculation by investors and market sentiment is a major factor in the behaviour of share prices.
Behavioural finance is an alternative view to the efficient market hypothesis. It attempts to explain the
market implications of the psychological factors behind investor decisions and suggests that irrational
investor behaviour may significantly affect share price movements. These factors may explain why share
prices appear sometimes to overreact to past price changes.

Behavioural finance considers the emotional and 'illogical' factors that affect the decision-making of
investors. These behavioural factors may explain why investors often do not act rationally. For example,
behavioural theory may explain stock market bubbles, such as inexplicable bubbles in the share prices of
technology stocks (in the early 2000s and the 2010s in the US) and a stock market crash, like the crashes
of 1929 and 1987.

Chapter Roundup




The theory behind share price movements can be explained by the three forms of the efficient market
hypothesis.
–

Weak form efficiency implies that prices reflect all relevant information about past price
movements and their implications.

–

Semi-strong form efficiency implies that prices reflect past price movements and publicly available
knowledge.

–

Strong form efficiency implies that prices reflect past price movements, publicly available
knowledge and inside knowledge.

Fundamental analysis is based on the theory that share prices can be derived from a rational analysis of
future dividends.
Technical analysts or chartists work on the basis that past price patterns will be repeated, therefore
future price movements can be predicted from historical patterns of share price movements in the past,
and there are some patterns that continually reappear.
Random walk theory is based on the idea that share prices will alter when new information becomes
available.

Share prices are also affected by marketability and liquidity of shares, availability and sources of
information, market imperfections and pricing anomalies, market capitalisation and investor speculation.

Introduction
In Part G, we look at various techniques for the management of risk, in
particular foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. In this chapter, we are
particularly concerned with risks related to exchange rate fluctuations.
The first section contains some very important basic concepts so make sure
you're happy with how foreign exchange rates are quoted and the causes of
exchange rate fluctuations.
The techniques to hedge foreign currency risk are covered in Section 4.
Forward exchange rate calculations are straightforward, but you need to use a
step by step approach to tackle money market hedges. Don't feel overwhelmed
by the terminology in the derivatives section; you need to identify the main
types of derivative and will not need to perform any calculations.
