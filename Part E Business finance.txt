1 Short-term sources of finance
FAST FORWARD

A range of short-term sources of finance are available to businesses including overdrafts, short-term
loans, trade credit and short-term leases.
Short-term finance is usually needed for businesses to run their day to day operations including payment
of wages to employees, inventory ordering and supplies. Businesses with seasonal peaks and troughs and
those engaged in international trade are likely to be heavy users of short-term finance.

1.1 Overdrafts
Where payments from a current account exceed income to the account for a temporary period, the bank
may agree to finance a deficit balance on the account by means of an overdraft. Overdrafts are the most
important source of short-term finance available to businesses. They can be arranged relatively quickly
and offer a level of flexibility with regard to the amount borrowed at any time, while interest is only paid
when the account is overdrawn.
Overdrafts
Amount

The bank specifies an overdraft limit. The overdrawn (negative) balance on the
account cannot exceed this limit. The bank usually decides the limit with reference
to the borrower's known income. Overdraft borrowing is through the borrower's
normal business bank account.

Margin

Interest charged at the bank's administrative base rate plus a margin. This rate is
usually higher than the rate for a short-term bank loan.
Interest is calculated daily on the amount overdrawn and is charged to the
borrower's account quarterly (or monthly). An additional fee may be charged for
arranging a large-size overdraft facility.

Purpose

Generally to cover short-term deficits in cash flows from normal business
operations. The borrower may not want to retain large amounts of cash in a bank
account, earning no interest; therefore some negative cash balances may occur.

Repayment

Technically repayable on demand. If a bank ends an overdraft facility without
warning, the borrower could face a risk of insolvency.

Security

Depends on size of facility. The bank may ask for security (collateral) but often does
not.

Benefits

The customer has flexible means of short-term borrowing; the bank has to accept
fluctuations in amount of lending.

By providing an overdraft facility to a customer, the bank is committing itself to providing an overdraft to
the customer whenever the customer wants it, up to the agreed limit. The bank will earn interest on the
lending, but only to the extent that the customer uses the facility and goes into their overdraft. If the
customer does not go into their overdraft, the bank cannot charge interest.
The bank will generally charge a commitment fee when a customer is granted an overdraft facility or an
increase in their overdraft facility. This is a fee for granting an overdraft facility and agreeing to provide the
customer with funds if and whenever they need them.

1.1.1 Overdrafts and the operating cycle
Many businesses require their bank to provide financial assistance for normal trading over the operating
cycle.
For example, suppose that a business has the following working capital position.
$
Inventories and trade receivables
Bank overdraft
Trade payables
Working capital

$
10,000

1,000
3,000
4,000
6,000

It now buys inventory costing $2,500 for cash, using its overdraft. Working capital remains the same,
$6,000, although the bank's financial stake has risen from $1,000 to $3,500.
$
$
Inventories and trade receivables
12,500
Bank overdraft
3,500
Trade payables
3,000
6,500
Working capital
6,000
A bank overdraft provides support for normal trading finance. In this example, finance for normal trading
rises from $(10,000 3,000) = $7,000 to $(12,500 3,000) = $9,500 and the bank's contribution rises
from $1,000 out of $7,000 to $3,500 out of $9,500.
A feature of bank lending to support normal trading finance is that the amount of the overdraft required at
any time will depend on the cash flows of the business – the timing of receipts and payments, seasonal
variations in trade patterns, and so on. The purpose of the overdraft is to bridge the gap between cash
payments and cash receipts.

1.1.2 Solid core overdrafts
When a business customer has an overdraft facility, and the account is always in overdraft, then it has a
solid core (or hard core) overdraft. For example, suppose that the account of a company has the following
record for the previous year.
Average
Debit

700,000
31 December 20X5
80,000 debit
110,000 debit
–
60,000 debit
550,000
These figures show that the account has been permanently in overdraft, and the hard core of the overdraft
has been rising steeply over the course of the year.
If the hard core element of the overdraft appears to be becoming a long-term feature of the business, the
bank might wish, after discussions with the customer, to convert the hard core of the overdraft into a
loan, thus giving formal recognition to its more permanent nature. Otherwise annual reductions in the
hard core of an overdraft would typically be a requirement of the bank.

1.2 Short-term loans
A term loan is a loan for a fixed amount for a specified period, usually from a bank. The loan may have a
specific purpose, such as the purchase of an asset. It is drawn in full at the beginning of the loan period
and repaid at a specified time or in defined instalments. Term loans are offered with a variety of
repayment schedules. Often, the interest and capital repayments are predetermined.

234

12: Sources of finance

Part E Business finance
w


The bank establishes a separate loan account for the loan, charging interest to the account and setting off
loan payments against the balance on the account.
The main advantage of lending on a loan account for the bank is that it makes monitoring and control of
the advance much easier, because the loan cash flows are recorded in a separate account. The bank can
see immediately when the customer is falling behind with their repayments, or struggling to make the
payments. With overdraft lending, a customer's difficulties might be obscured for some time by the variety
of transactions on their current account.
(a)

The customer knows what they will be expected to pay back at regular intervals and the bank can
also predict its future income with more certainty (depending on whether the interest rate is fixed
or floating).

(b)

Once the loan is agreed, the term of the loan must be adhered to, provided that the customer does
not fall behind with their repayments. It is not repayable on demand by the bank.

(c)

Because the bank will be committing its funds to a customer for a number of years, it may wish to
insist on building certain written safeguards into the loan agreement, to prevent the customer
from becoming overextended with their borrowing during the course of the loan. A loan covenant
is a condition that the borrower must comply with. If the borrower does not act in accordance with
the covenants, the loan can be considered in default and the bank can demand payment.

1.3 Overdrafts and short-term loans compared
A customer might ask the bank for an overdraft facility when the bank would wish to suggest a loan
instead; alternatively, a customer might ask for a loan when an overdraft would be more appropriate.
(a)

In most cases, when a customer wants finance to help with 'day to day' trading and cash flow
needs, an overdraft would be the appropriate method of financing. The customer should not be
short of cash all the time, and should expect to be in credit in some days, but in need of an
overdraft on others.

(b)

When a customer wants to borrow from a bank for only a short period of time, even for the
purchase of a major fixed asset, such as an item of plant or machinery, an overdraft facility might
be more suitable than a loan, because the customer will stop paying interest as soon as their
account goes into credit.

1.3.1 Advantages of an overdraft over a loan
(a)

The customer only pays interest when they are overdrawn.

(b)

The bank has the flexibility to review the customer's overdraft facility periodically, and perhaps
agree to additional facilities, or insist on a reduction in the facility.

(c)

An overdraft can do the same job as a loan: a facility can simply be renewed every time it comes
up for review.

Bear in mind, however, that overdrafts are normally repayable on demand.

1.3.2 Advantages of a loan for longer-term lending
(a)

Both the customer and the bank know exactly what the repayments of the loan will be and how
much interest is payable, and when. This makes planning (budgeting) simpler.

(b)

The interest rate on the loan balance is likely to be lower than the interest charged on overdrawn
balances. The comparative cost therefore depends on the size and duration of borrowing
requirements.

(c)

The customer does not have to worry about the bank deciding to reduce or withdraw an overdraft
facility before they are in a position to repay what is owed. There is an element of 'security' or 'peace
of mind' in being able to arrange a loan for an agreed term.

(d)

Loans normally carry a facility letter setting out the precise terms of the agreement.

However, a mix of overdrafts and loans might be suggested in some cases. Consider a case where a
business asks for a loan, perhaps to purchase a shop with inventory. The banker might wish to suggest a
loan to help with the purchase of the shop, but that inventory ought to be financed by an overdraft facility.
The offer of part-loan part-overdraft is an option that might be well worth considering.

1.3.3 Calculation of repayments on a loan
We can use an annuity table to calculate the repayments on a loan.
For example, a $30,000 loan is taken out by a business at a rate of 12% over five years. What will be the
annual payment, assuming that payments are made every 12 months and the loan provides for gradual
repayment over the term of the loan?
The annuity factor for 12% over five years is 3.605. Therefore $30,000 = 3.605
Annual payment

30,000

=

= $8,321.78

1.3.4 The split between interest and capital repayment
A loan of $100,000 is to be repaid to the bank, over five years, in equal annual year-end instalments made
up of capital repayments and interest at 9% p.a.
The annual payment =

1.4 Trade credit
Trade credit is a major source of short-term finance for a business. Current assets such as raw materials
may be purchased on credit, with payment terms normally varying from between 30 and 90 days. Trade
credit therefore represents an interest-free short-term loan. In a period of high inflation, purchasing via
trade credit will be very helpful in keeping costs down. However, it is important to take into account the
loss of discounts suppliers offer for early payment.
Unacceptable delays in payment will worsen a company's credit rating and additional credit may become
difficult to obtain.

1.5 Leasing
Rather than buying an asset outright, using either available cash resources or borrowed funds, a business
may lease an asset. Leasing is a popular source of finance.
Leasing can be defined as a contract between lessor and lessee for hire of a specific asset selected from a
manufacturer or vendor of such assets by the lessee. The lessor retains ownership of the asset. The lessee
has possession and use of the asset on payment of specified rentals over a period. Short-term leases are a
source of short-term finance for non-current assets.

236

12: Sources of finance

Part E Business finance
w


Many lessors are financial intermediaries, such as banks and insurance companies. The range of assets
leased is wide, including office equipment and computers, cars and commercial vehicles, aircraft, ships
and buildings.
Leasing was covered in detail in Chapter 11 of this Study Text.

1.5.1 Sale and leaseback
Sale and leaseback arrangements were also explained in Chapter 11.
A company which owns its own premises can obtain finance by selling the property to an insurance
company or pension fund for immediate cash and renting it back, usually for at least 50 years with rent
reviews every few years.
A company would raise more cash from sale and leaseback arrangements than from a mortgage, but there
are significant disadvantages.
(a)

The company loses ownership of a valuable asset which is almost certain to appreciate over time.

(b)

The future borrowing capacity of the firm will be reduced, as there will be fewer assets to provide
security for a loan.

(c)

The company is contractually committed to occupying the property for many years ahead which
can be restricting.

(d)

The real cost is likely to be high, particularly as there will be frequent rent reviews.

2 Long-term debt finance
FAST FORWARD

6/10, 12/10, 6/14

A range of long-term sources of finance are available to businesses including debt finance, leasing,
venture capital and equity finance.
Long-term finance is used for major investments and is usually more expensive and less flexible than
short-term finance.

2.1 Reasons for seeking long-term debt finance
Sometimes businesses may need long-term funds, but may not wish to issue equity capital. Perhaps the
current shareholders will be unwilling to contribute additional capital; possibly the company does not
wish to involve outside shareholders who will have more onerous requirements than current members.
Other reasons for choosing debt finance may include lesser cost and easier availability, particularly if the
company has little or no existing debt finance. Debt finance provides tax relief on interest payments.

2.2 Sources of debt finance
If a company does wish to raise debt finance, it will need to consider what type of finance will be available.
If it is seeking medium-term bank finance, it ought to be in the form of a loan. Bank finance is an
important source of both short-term and longer-term debt for small companies, and we shall consider this
in greater detail in Chapter 15.
If a company is seeking to issue loan notes (bonds), it must decide whether to make an issue of
'conventional' loan notes, or whether investors may be attracted by a different type of loan note issue,
such as convertible loan notes.

2.3 Factors influencing choice of debt finance
FAST FORWARD

6/15, Sep/Dec 15

The choice of debt finance that a company can make depends on:


The size of the company; a public issue of loan notes is only available to a large company



The duration of the required financing



Whether a fixed or floating interest rate is preferred (fixed rates are more expensive, but floating
rates are riskier)



The security (collateral) that can be offered and the security that may be demanded by a lender

In Chapter 15, we shall look in detail at the factors that determine the mix of debt and equity finance that a
company chooses. For now, you need to bear in mind when reading this chapter the following
considerations influencing what type of debt finance is sought.
(a)

Availability

Only listed companies are able to make a public issue of loan notes. With a 'public issue' the loan notes
are listed on a stock market. Most investors will not invest in loan notes issued by small companies.
Smaller companies are only able to obtain significant amounts of debt finance from a bank.
(b)

Credit rating

Large companies may prefer to issue loan notes if they have a strong credit rating. Credit ratings
are given to loan note issues by credit rating agencies. The credit rating given to a loan note issue
affects the interest yield that investors will require. If a company's loan notes would only be given a
sub-investment grade rating ('junk bond' rating), the company may prefer to seek debt finance
from a bank loan.
(c)

Amount

Loan note issues are usually for large amounts. If a company wants to borrow only a small amount
of money, a bank loan would be appropriate.
(d)

Duration

If loan finance is sought to buy a particular asset to generate revenues for the business, the length
of the loan should match the length of time that the asset will be generating revenues.
(e)

Fixed or floating rate
Expectations of interest rate movements will determine whether a company wants to borrow at a
fixed or floating rate. Fixed-rate finance may be more expensive, but the business runs the risk of
adverse upward rate movements if it chooses floating rate finance. Banks may refuse to lend at a
fixed rate for more than a given period of time.

(f)

Security and covenants

The choice of finance may be determined by the assets that the business is willing or able to offer
as security, and by the restrictions in covenants that the lenders wish to impose.

Part E Business finance
w


Key term

Loan notes are long-term debt capital raised by a company for which interest is paid, usually half yearly
and at a fixed rate. Holders of loan notes are therefore long-term payables for the company.

2.4.1 Conventional loan notes
Conventional loan notes are fixed-rate redeemable securities.
Loan notes have a nominal value, which is the debt owed by the company, and interest is paid at a stated
'coupon' on this amount. For example, if a company issues 10% loan notes, the coupon will be 10% of the
nominal value of the loan notes, so that $100 of loan notes will receive $10 interest each year. The rate
quoted is the gross rate, before tax.
Unlike shares, debt is often issued at nominal value, ie with $100 payable per $100 nominal value, or
close to nominal value. Loan note prices are quoted per $100 nominal value of loan notes, so a price of
$98.65 means a market price of $98.65 per $100 nominal value.
Where the coupon rate is fixed at the time of issue, it will be set according to prevailing market
conditions given the credit rating of the company issuing the debt. Subsequent changes in market (and
company) conditions will cause the market value of the loan note to fluctuate, although the coupon will
stay at the fixed percentage of the nominal value.
Loan notes issued by large companies are marketable, but bond markets are small. When a company
issues new equity shares, the new shares rank equally with all existing equity shares, and can be bought
and sold in the same market. In contrast, each loan note issue is different, with its own interest rate and
redemption date; the market for different loan note issues by the same company cannot be combined. This
is why equities may be extensively traded on a stock market, but loan notes are not.

2.5 Deep discount loan notes
Key term

Deep discount loan notes are issued at a price which is at a large discount to the nominal value of the
notes, and which will be redeemable at nominal value (or above nominal value) when they eventually
mature.

For example a company might issue $1,000,000 of loan notes in 20X1, at a price of $50 per $100 nominal
value, and redeemable at nominal value in the year 20X9. The coupon rate of interest will be very low
compared with yields on conventional loan notes with the same maturity. For a company with specific
cash flow requirements, the low servicing costs during the currency of the loan note may be an attraction,
coupled with a high cost of redemption at maturity.
Investors might be attracted by the large capital gain offered by the loan notes, which is the difference
between the issue price and the redemption value. However, deep discount loan notes will carry a much
lower rate of interest than other types of loan note. The only tax advantage is that the gain gets taxed (as
income) in one lump on maturity or sale, not as amounts of interest each year. The borrower can,
however, deduct notional interest each year in computing profits.
The main benefit of deep discount loan notes for a company is that the interest yield on the loan notes is
lower than on conventional loan notes. However, it will have to pay a much larger amount at maturity than
it borrowed when the loan notes were issued. Deep discount loan notes defer much of the cost of the debt.

wPart E

239

2.6 Zero coupon loan notes
Key term

Zero coupon loan notes are issued at a discount to their redemption value, but no interest is paid on
them.

Zero coupon loan notes are an extreme form of deep discount bond. For example, a company may issue
zero coupon discount loan notes at 75.00, pay no interest at all, but at maturity (say, five years later)
redeem the loan notes at 100.00. The investor gains from the difference between the issue price and the
redemption value ($25 per $75 invested). There is an implied interest rate in the amount of discount at
which the loan notes are issued (or subsequently resold on the market).
(a)

The advantage for borrowers is that zero coupon loan notes can be used to raise cash
immediately, and there is no cash repayment until redemption date. The cost of redemption is
known at the time of issue. The borrower can plan to have funds available to redeem the loan notes
at maturity.

(b)

The advantage for lenders is restricted, unless the rate of discount on the loan notes offers a high
yield. The only way of obtaining cash from the loan notes before maturity is to sell them. Their
market value will depend on the remaining term to maturity and current market interest rates.

The tax advantage of zero coupon loan notes is the same as that of deep discount loan notes (see 2.5
above).
Deep discount loan notes and zero coupon loan notes are not common. Companies must want to pay little
or no interest and incur the main cost at redemption. Investors must have reasons for wanting to invest in
these loan notes, rather than in conventional loan notes.

2.7 Convertible loan notes
FAST FORWARD

Sep/Dec 17

Convertible loan notes give the holder the right to convert to other securities, normally ordinary shares, at
a predetermined price/rate and time.

Convertible loan notes are fixed-rate bonds. The coupon rate of interest is lower than on similar
conventional loan notes. They give the loan note holders the right (but not an obligation) to convert their
loan notes at a specified future date into new equity shares of the company, at a conversion rate that is
also specified when the loan notes are issued.
For example, the conversion terms for a convertible loan note may be that on 1 April 20X0, $100 of loan
notes can be converted into 40 ordinary shares, whereas on 1 April 20X1, the conversion rate is 45
ordinary shares per $100 of loan notes. Once converted, convertible securities cannot be converted back
into the original fixed return security.
If the loan note holders choose not to convert their loan notes into shares, the loan notes will be redeemed
at maturity, usually at nominal rate.

2.7.1 The conversion value and the conversion premium
The current market value of ordinary shares into which a loan note may be converted is known as the
conversion value. The conversion value will be below the value of the loan note at the date of issue, but
will be expected to increase as the date for conversion approaches on the assumption that a company's
shares ought to increase in market value over time.
Conversion value = Conversion ratio × market price per share
Conversion premium = Current market value – current conversion value

Question

Convertible debt

The 10% convertible loan notes of Starchwhite are quoted at $142 per $100 nominal. The earliest date for
conversion is in four years' time, at the rate of 30 ordinary shares per $100 nominal loan note value. The
share price is currently $4.15. Annual interest on the loan notes has just been paid.
Required

(a)
(b)

Calculate the current conversion value.
Calculate the conversion premium and comment on its meaning.

Answer
(a)
(b)

Conversion ratio is $100 loan note = 30 ordinary shares
Conversion value = 30 × $4.15 = $124.50
17.50
× 100% = 14%
Conversion premium = $(142 – 124.50) = $17.50 or
124.50
The share price will have to rise by 14% before the conversion rights become attractive.

2.7.2 The issue price and the market price of convertible loan notes
A company will aim to issue loan notes with the greatest possible conversion premium, as this will mean
that for the amount of capital raised it will, on conversion, have to issue the lowest number of new
ordinary shares. The premium that will be accepted by potential investors will depend on the company's
growth potential and so on prospects for a sizeable increase in the share price.
Convertible loan notes issued at nominal have a lower coupon rate of interest than similar conventional
loan notes. This lower interest rate is the price the investor has to pay for the conversion rights. It is, of
course, also one of the reasons why the issue of convertible loan notes is attractive to a company.
A (large) company may issue convertible loan notes rather than conventional loan notes in order to benefit
from lower interest costs, even if this means having to issue new shares in the future, when profits and
cash flows are stronger.
When convertible loan notes are traded on a stock market, their minimum market price or floor value will
be the price of conventional loan notes with the same coupon rate of interest. If the market value falls to
this minimum, it follows that the market attaches no value to the conversion rights.
The actual market price of convertible loan notes will depend on:






The price of straight debt
The current conversion value
The length of time before conversion may take place
The market's expectation as to future equity returns and the risk associated with these returns

Most companies issuing convertible loan notes expect them to be converted. They view the loan notes as
delayed equity. They are often used either because the company's ordinary share price is considered to be
particularly depressed at the time of issue or because the issue of equity shares would result in an immediate
and significant drop in earnings per share. There is no certainty, however, that the security holders will
exercise their option to convert; therefore the loan notes may run their full term and need to be redeemed.

2.7.3 Example: Convertible loan notes
CD has issued 50,000 units of convertible loan notes, each with a nominal value of $100 and a coupon
rate of interest of 10% payable yearly. Each $100 of convertible loan notes may be converted into 40
ordinary shares of CD in three years' time. Any loan notes not converted will be redeemed at 110 (that is,
at $110 per $100 nominal value of loan note).
Estimate the likely current market price for $100 of the loan notes, if investors in the loan notes now require
a pre-tax return of only 8%, and the expected value of CD ordinary shares on the conversion day is:

Solution
(a)

Shares are valued at $2.50 each.
If shares are only expected to be worth $2.50 each on conversion day, the value of 40 shares will
be $100, and investors in the debt will presumably therefore redeem their debt at 110 instead of
converting them into shares.
The market value of $100 of the convertible debt will be the discounted present value of the
expected future income stream.

2.8 Security
Loan notes may be secured. Bank loans are often secured. Security may take the form of either a fixed
charge or a floating charge.
Fixed charge

Floating charge

Security relates to specific asset/group
of assets (land and buildings)

Security in event of default is whatever assets of the class
secured (inventory/trade receivables) company then owns

Company can't dispose of assets
without providing substitute/consent of
lender

Company can dispose of assets until default takes place
In event of default lenders appoint receiver rather than lay claim
to asset

Investors are likely to expect a higher yield with unsecured loan notes to compensate them for the extra
risk. Similarly, a bank may charge higher interest for an unsecured loan compared with a similar secured
loan.

2.9 The redemption of loan notes
Key term

242

Redemption is a term for the repayment of preference shares and loan notes at maturity.

12: Sources of finance

Part E Business finance

Loan notes are usually redeemable. They are issued for a term of ten years or more, and perhaps 25 to 30
years. At the end of this period, they will 'mature' and become redeemable (at nominal value or possibly at
a value above nominal value).
Most redeemable loan notes have an earliest and a latest redemption date. For example, 12% Loan note
20X7/X9 is redeemable at any time between the earliest specified date (in 20X7) and the latest date (in
20X9). The issuing company can choose the date.
Some loan notes do not have a redemption date, and are 'irredeemable' or 'undated'. These are rare in
reality and are typically only issued by governments, not companies.

2.9.1 How will a company finance the redemption of long-term debt?
There is no guarantee that a company will be able to raise a new loan to pay off a maturing debt. One item
you should look for in a company's statement of financial position is the redemption date of current
loans, to establish how much new finance is likely to be needed by the company, and when.
Occasionally, perhaps because the secured assets have fallen in value and would not realise much in a
forced sale, or perhaps out of a belief that the company can improve its position soon, unpaid loan note
holders may be persuaded to surrender their loan notes. In exchange they may receive an equity interest
in the company or convertible loan notes, paying a lower rate of interest, but carrying the option to
convert the loan notes into shares at a specified time in the future.

2.10 Tax relief on loan interest
As far as companies are concerned, debt capital is a potentially attractive source of finance because
interest charges are an allowable expense for tax purposes. Interest charges reduce the profits chargeable
to corporation tax. Dividend payments to shareholders do not attract tax relief. The after-tax cost of debt
can therefore be much lower than the cost of equity.
(a)
(b)

A new issue of loan notes is likely to be preferable to a new issue of preference shares (preference
shares are shares carrying a fixed rate of dividends).
Companies might wish to avoid dilution of shareholdings and increase gearing (the ratio of fixed
interest capital to equity capital) in order to improve their earnings per share by benefiting from tax
relief on interest payments.

3 Venture capital
Key term

Venture capital is risk capital, normally provided by a venture capital firm or individual venture capitalist,
in return for an equity stake.

Venture capital is capital that is invested (or is available for investing) in private companies. The venture
capital may be provided by a wealthy individual, or it may be provided by a venture capital firm that
manages a venture capital fund. (A venture capital fund consists of money from investors for investing in
private company equity.)
Venture capitalists seek to invest cash in return for shares in private companies with high growth
potential. They seek a high return, which is often realised through a stock market listing.
Venture capital may be invested in young start-up companies, but is more commonly invested in small
companies that already have a track record of business development and which need additional finance to
grow. These companies may have borrowed as much money as their banks are prepared to lend, and do
not have enough equity capital (from the existing owners or retained profits) to expand at the rate or scale
required.
Venture capital organisations have been operating for many years. There is now quite a large number of
such organisations. For example:

Business finance

12: Sources of finance

243

(a)

The British Venture Capital Association is a regulatory body for all the institutions that have joined
it as members.

(b)

Investors in Industry plc, or the 3i group as it is more commonly known, is the biggest and oldest
of the venture capital organisations. It is involved in many venture capital schemes in Europe,
Singapore, Japan and the US.

Venture capitalists want to invest in companies that are ambitious. The characteristics of an attractive
investment will might include the following:





Highly motivated individuals with a strong management team in place
A well-defined strategy aiming at market leadership
A clearly defined target market
Best in class strategic, operational and financial practices.

The types of venture that a venture capitalists might invest in include the following.
(a)

Business start-ups. When a business has been set up by someone who has already put time and
money into getting it started, the group may be willing to provide finance to enable it to get off the
ground.

(b)

Business development. The group may be willing to provide development capital for a company
which wants to invest in new products or new markets or to make a business acquisition, and so
which needs a major capital injection.

(c)

Management buyouts. A management buyout is the purchase of all or parts of a business from its
owners by its managers.

(d)

Helping a company where one of its owners wants to realise all or part of their investment. The 3i
group may be prepared to buy some of the company's equity.

3.1 Venture capital funds
Some other organisations are engaged in the creation of venture capital funds. In these the organisation
raises venture capital funds from investors and invests in management buyouts or expanding companies.
The venture capital fund managers usually reward themselves by taking a percentage of the portfolio of
the fund's investments.

3.2 Finding venture capital
When a company's directors look for help from a venture capital institution, they must recognise that:
(a)

The institution will want an equity stake in the company.

(b)

It will need convincing that the company can be successful (management buyouts of companies
which already have a record of successful trading have been increasingly favoured by venture
capitalists in recent years).

(c)

It may want to have a representative appointed to the company's board, to look after its interests,
or an independent director (the 3i group runs an Independent Director Scheme).

The directors of the company must then contact venture capital organisations, to try to find one or more
which would be willing to offer finance. Typically, a venture capitalist will consider offering finance of
$500,000 upwards. A venture capital organisation will only give funds to a company that it believes can
succeed.
A venture capitalist may also agree to invest in some redeemable preference shares as well as equity, but
will want a suitable proportion of the company's equity as part of the financing arrangement.
When a venture capitalist invests in new equity for a company, the company's bank may also be prepared
to lend more, because the company is now seen as a lower credit risk.

A survey has indicated that around 75% of requests for venture capital are rejected on an initial screening,
and only about 3% of all requests survive both this screening and further investigation and result in actual
investments.

invest.

4 Equity finance and preference shares
FAST FORWARD

12/14, 9/16, 12/16,
Mar/Jun 18

Equity finance is raised through the sale of ordinary shares to investors via a new issue or a rights issue.

4.1 Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares are issued to the owners of a company. Ordinary shares in many countries have a
nominal or 'face' value, typically $1 or 50c. In some countries, equity shares no longer have a nominal
value.

You should understand that the market value of a quoted company's shares bears no relationship to their
nominal value except that, when ordinary shares are issued for cash, the issue price must be equal to or
(more usually) more than the nominal value of the shares.
Ordinary shareholders have rights as a result of their ownership of the shares.
(a)

Shareholders can attend company general meetings.

(b)

They can vote on important company matters such as the appointment and re-election of directors;
approving a takeover bid for another company, where the financing arrangements will involve a
large new issue of shares; the appointment of auditors; or (possibly, as in the UK) approving the
company's remuneration policy for senior executives.

(c)

They are entitled to receive a share of any agreed dividend.

(d)

They will receive the annual report and accounts.

(e)

They will receive a share of any assets remaining after liquidation.

(f)

They can participate in any new issue of shares, unless they agree to waive this right.

Ordinary shareholders are the ultimate bearers of risk, as they are at the bottom of the creditor hierarchy
in a liquidation. This means there is a significant risk they will receive nothing after settlement of all the
company's liabilities.
This high equity risk means that shareholders expect the highest return of long-term providers of finance,
in the form of dividend yields, dividend growth and share price growth. The cost of equity finance is
therefore always higher than the cost of debt.

4.3 Disadvantages of a stock market listing
The owners of a company seeking a stock market listing must take the following disadvantages into
account.
(a)

(b)
(c)

There will be significantly greater public regulation, accountability and scrutiny. The legal
requirements the company faces will be greater, and the company will also be subject to the rules
of the stock exchange on which its shares are listed.
A wider circle of investors with more exacting requirements will hold shares.
There will be additional costs involved in making share issues, including brokerage commissions
and underwriting fees.

4.4 Methods of obtaining a listing
An unquoted company that is becoming listed for the first time can issue shares on the stock market by
means of:




An initial public offer (IPO)
A placing
An introduction

4.4.1 Initial public offer
Key term

An initial public offer (IPO) is an invitation to apply for shares in a company based on information
contained in a prospectus.
An initial public offer (IPO) is a means of selling the shares of a company to the public at large for the
first time. When companies 'go public' for the first time, a large issue will probably take the form of an
IPO. This is known as flotation. Subsequent issues are likely to be placings or rights issues, described
later.
An IPO entails the acquisition by an issuing house (an investment bank acting for the company) of a large
block of shares of a company, with a view to offering them for sale to the public and investing institutions.
An issuing house is usually an investment bank. It may acquire the shares either as a direct allotment from
the company or by purchase from existing shareholders. In either case, the issuing house publishes an
invitation to the public to apply for shares, either at a fixed price or on a tender basis. The issuing house
accepts responsibility to the public, and gives to the issue the support of its own standing.

246

12: Sources of finance

Part E Business finance
w


In an IPO, the company's shareholders may take the opportunity to sell some of their shares. They receive
the money from these share sales. In addition, the company will issue new shares in the IPO to raise
equity finance for investment.

4.4.2 A placing
A placing is an arrangement whereby, instead of offering the shares to the general public, the sponsoring
investment bank arranges for most of the issue to be bought by a small number of investors, usually
institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies.

4.4.3 The choice between an IPO and a placing
Is a company likely to prefer an IPO of its shares, or a placing?
(a)

Placings are much cheaper. Approaching institutional investors privately is a much cheaper way of
obtaining finance, and thus placings are often used for smaller issues.

(b)

Placings are likely to be quicker.

(c)

Placings are likely to involve less disclosure of information.

(d)

However, most of the shares will be placed with a relatively small number of (institutional)
shareholders, which means that most of the shares are unlikely to be available for trading after
the flotation, and that institutional shareholders will have control of the company.

(e)

When a company first comes to the market, there may be a restriction on the proportion of shares
that can be placed, or a minimum proportion that must be offered to the general public.

4.4.4 A stock exchange introduction
By this method of obtaining a quotation, no shares are made available to the market, neither existing nor
newly created shares; nevertheless, the stock market grants a quotation. This will only happen where
shares in a large private company are already widely held, so that a market can be seen to exist. A
company might want an introduction to obtain greater marketability for the shares, a known share
valuation for inheritance tax purposes and easier access in the future to additional capital.

4.5 Costs of share issues on the stock market
Companies may incur the following costs when issuing shares.



Underwriting costs (see below)



Stock market listing fee (the initial charge) for the new securities



Fees of the issuing house (investment bank), solicitors, auditors and public relations consultant



Charges for printing and distributing the prospectus: (the prospectus is the document in which the
company offers its shares for sale)



Advertising in national newspapers

4.5.1 Underwriting
A company about to issue new securities in order to raise finance may decide to have the issue
underwritten. Underwriters are financial institutions which agree (in exchange for a fixed fee, perhaps
2.25% of the finance to be raised) to buy at the issue price any securities which are not subscribed for by
the investing public.
Underwriters remove the risk of a share issue's being undersubscribed, but at a cost to the company
issuing the shares. It is not compulsory to have an issue underwritten. Ordinary offers for sale (IPOs) are
likely to be underwritten, although rights issues may be as well.

Future trading
prospects

Companies will be keen to avoid overpricing an issue, which could result in the issue being
undersubscribed, leaving underwriters with the unwelcome task of having to buy up the unsold shares.
On the other hand, if the issue price is too low then the issue will be oversubscribed and the company
would have been able to raise the required capital by issuing fewer shares.
The share price of an issue is usually advertised as being based on a certain P/E ratio, the ratio of the price
to the company's most recent earnings per share figure in its audited accounts. The issuer's P/E ratio can
then be compared by investors with the P/E ratios of similar quoted companies. (We covered P/E ratios in
Chapter 1.)

4.7 Rights issues
FAST FORWARD

A rights issue is an offer to existing shareholders enabling them to buy more shares, usually at a price
lower than the current market price, and in proportion to their existing shareholding.
A rights issue provides a way of raising new share capital by means of an offer to existing shareholders,
inviting them to subscribe cash for new shares in proportion to their existing holdings.
For example, a rights issue on a one for four basis at 280c per share would mean that a company is
inviting its existing shareholders to subscribe for one new share for every four shares they hold, at a price
of 280c per new share. A rights issue may be made by any type of company. The analysis below, however,
applies primarily to listed companies.
The major advantages of a rights issue are as follows.

248

(a)

Rights issues are cheaper than IPOs to the general public. This is partly because no prospectus is
normally required, partly because the administration is simpler and partly because the cost of
underwriting will be less.

(b)

Rights issues are more beneficial to existing shareholders than issues to the general public. New
shares are issued at a discount to the current market price to make them attractive to investors. A
rights issue secures the discount on the market price for existing shareholders, who may either
keep the shares or sell them if they wish.

(c)

Relative voting rights are unaffected if shareholders all take up their rights.

(d)

The finance raised may be used to reduce gearing in book value terms by increasing share capital
and/or to pay off long-term debt which will reduce gearing in market value terms. We will look at
gearing in more detail in Chapter 15.

4.8 Deciding the issue price for a rights issue
The offer price in a rights issue will be lower than the current market price of existing shares. The size of
the discount will vary, and will be larger for difficult issues. In the UK, however, the offer price must be at
or above the nominal value of the shares, so as not to contravene company law.
A company making a rights issue must set a price which is low enough to secure the acceptance of
shareholders, who are being asked to provide extra funds, but not too low, so as to avoid excessive
dilution of the earnings per share.

Exam focus
point

A question could ask for discussion of the effect of a rights issue, as well as calculations, eg of the effect
on EPS.

4.9 Example: Rights issue (1)
Seagull can achieve a profit after tax of 20% on the capital employed. At present its capital structure is as
follows.
$
200,000 ordinary shares of $1 each
200,000
Retained earnings
100,000
300,000
The directors propose to raise an additional $126,000 from a rights issue. The current market price is
$1.80.
Required

(a)
(b)

Calculate the number of shares that must be issued if the rights price is:
$1.60; $1.50; $1.40; $1.20.
Calculate the dilution in earnings per share in each case.

Solution
The earnings at present are 20% of $300,000 = $60,000. This gives earnings per share of 30c. The
earnings after the rights issue will be 20% of $426,000 = $85,200.

Note that at a high rights price the earnings per share are increased, not diluted. The breakeven point (zero
dilution) occurs when the rights price is equal to the capital employed per share: $300,000/200,000 = $1.50.

4.9.1 The market price of shares after a rights issue: the theoretical ex-rights price
When a rights issue is announced, all existing shareholders have the right to subscribe for new shares,
and so there are rights attached to the existing shares. The shares are therefore described as being 'cum
rights' (with rights attached) and are traded cum rights. On the first day of dealings in the newly issued
shares, the rights no longer exist and the old shares are now 'ex-rights' (without rights attached).
After the announcement of a rights issue, share prices normally fall. The extent and duration of the fall
may depend on the number of shareholders and the size of their holdings. This temporary fall is due to
uncertainty in the market about the consequences of the issue, with respect to future profits, earnings and
dividends.

wPart E

Business finance

12: Sources of finance

249

After the issue has actually been made, the market price per share will normally fall, because there are
more shares in issue and the new shares were issued at a discount price.
In theory, the new market price will be the consequence of an adjustment to allow for the discount price of
the new issue, and a theoretical ex-rights price can be calculated.

4.9.2 Example: Rights issue (2)
Fundraiser has 1,000,000 ordinary shares of $1 in issue, which have a market price on 1 September of
$2.10 per share. The company decides to make a rights issue, and offers its shareholders the right to
subscribe for one new share at $1.50 each for every four shares already held. After the announcement of
the issue, the share price fell to $1.95, but by the time just prior to the issue being made, it had recovered
to $2 per share. This market value just before the issue is known as the cum rights price. What is the
theoretical ex-rights price?

Solution
Value of the portfolio for a shareholder with 4 shares before the rights issue:
4 shares @ $2.00
1 share @ $1.50
5

$
8.00
1.50
9.50

So the value per share after the rights issue (or TERP) is 9.50/5 = $1.90.

4.9.3 The value of rights
The value of rights is the theoretical gain a shareholder would make by exercising their rights.
(a)

Using the above example, if the price offered in the rights issue is $1.50 per share, and the market
price after the issue is expected to be $1.90, the value attaching to a right is $1.90 – $1.50 = $0.40.
A shareholder would therefore be expected to gain 40 cents for each new share they buy.
If they do not have enough money to buy the share themselves, they could sell the right to
subscribe for a new share to another investor, and receive 40 cents from the sale. This other
investor would then buy the new share for $1.50, so that their total outlay to acquire the share
would be $0.40 + $1.50 = $1.90, the theoretical ex-rights price.

(b)

The value of rights attaching to existing shares is calculated in the same way. If the value of rights
on a new share is 40 cents, and there is a one for four rights issue, the value of the rights attaching
to each existing share is 40/4 = 10 cents.

4.9.4 The theoretical gain or loss to shareholders
The possible courses of action open to shareholders are:
(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

250

To 'take up' or 'exercise' the rights; that is, to buy the new shares at the rights price. Shareholders
who do this will maintain their percentage holdings in the company by subscribing for the new
shares.
To 'renounce' the rights and sell them on the market. Shareholders who do this will have lower
percentage holdings of the company's equity after the issue than before the issue, and the total
value of their shares will be less.
To renounce part of the rights and take up the remainder. For example, a shareholder may sell
enough of their rights to enable them to buy the remaining rights shares they are entitled to with
the sale proceeds, and so keep the total market value of their shareholding in the company
unchanged.
To do nothing. Shareholders may be protected from the consequences of their inaction because
rights not taken up are sold on a shareholder's behalf by the company. If new securities are not
taken up, they may be sold by the company to new subscribers for the benefit of the shareholders
who were entitled to the rights.

Question

Rights issue

Gopher has issued 3,000,000 ordinary shares of $1 each, which are at present selling for $4 per share.
The company plans to issue rights to purchase 1 new equity share at a price of $3.20 per share for every
three shares held. A shareholder who owns 900 shares thinks that they will suffer a loss in their personal

It follows that the shareholder, to protect their existing investment, should either exercise their rights or
sell them to another investor. If they do not exercise their rights, the new securities they were entitled to
subscribe for may be sold for their benefit by the company, and this would protect them from losing
wealth.

Exam focus
point

Rights issues are commonly examined and students need to have a good understanding of the mechanics
of rights issues.

4.10 The actual market price after a rights issue
The actual market price of a share after a rights issue may differ from the theoretical ex-rights price. This
will occur when:

4.10.1 Expected yield from new funds raised

Earnings yield from existing funds

The market will take a view of how profitably the new funds will be invested, and will value the shares
accordingly. An example will illustrate this point.

4.10.2 Example: Rights issue (3)
Musk currently has 4,000,000 ordinary shares in issue, valued at $2 each, and the company has annual
earnings equal to 20% of the market value of the shares. A one for four rights issue is proposed, at an
issue price of $1.50. If the market continues to value the shares on a price/earnings ratio of 5, what would

(a)

If the additional funds raised are expected to generate earnings at the same rate as existing funds,
the actual market value will probably be the same as the theoretical ex-rights price.

(b)

If the new funds are expected to generate earnings at a lower rate, the market value will fall below
the theoretical ex-rights price. If this happens, shareholders will lose.

(c)

If the new funds are expected to earn at a higher rate than current funds, the market value should
rise above the theoretical ex-rights price. If this happens, shareholders will profit by taking up their
rights.

The decision by individual shareholders as to whether they take up the offer will therefore depend on:




The expected rate of return on the investment (and the risk associated with it)
The return obtainable from other investments (allowing for the associated risk)

4.11 New issues of shares for listed companies
A listed company can also raise new equity finance through a public offer or a placing. Usually these
methods will be used as a method of refinancing or to finance growth. These methods of issuing shares
will dilute the ownership of the existing shareholders. They are also more expensive as a method of
raising equity finance than a rights issue, as the new issues can incur costs such as those covered in
Section 4.5.

4.12 Stock split
A stock split occurs where, for example, each ordinary share of $1 each is split into two shares of 50c
each, thus creating cheaper shares with greater marketability. There is possibly an added psychological
advantage in that investors may expect a company which splits its shares in this way to be planning for
substantial earnings growth and dividend growth in the future.
As a consequence, the market price of shares may benefit. For example, if one existing share of $1 has a
market value of $6, and is then split into two shares of 50c each, the market value of the new shares might
settle at, say, $3.10 instead of the expected $3, in anticipation of strong future growth in earnings and
dividends.
A stock split changes the share capital but does not raise any new equity finance for the company. It also
leaves the company's reserves (as shown in its statement of financial position) unaffected.

4.13 Scrip issue
A scrip issue occurs when a company issues new shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their
existing holdings at no charge. The issue is made out of distributable reserves (retained profits).
A scrip issue, like a stock split, raises no extra finance for the company.
The difference between a stock split and a scrip issue is that a scrip issue converts equity reserves into
share capital, whereas a stock split leaves reserves unaffected.

A company may make a scrip issue when it wants to pay a dividend to shareholders, but would prefer not
to pay the dividend in cash. Scrip dividends are explained in the next chapter.

4.14 Preference shares
Preference shares are shares which give the right to receive dividends (typically a fixed percentage of the
nominal value of the shares) before any dividends can be paid to ordinary shareholders.
As a source of finance, preference shares have several advantages over debt capital.
(a)

Dividends do not have to be paid if company performance is poor, whereas interest must be paid
on debt capital regardless of profit.

(b)

Preference shares are not secured on company assets.

(c)

Preference shareholders usually have no voting rights so there is no dilution of control.

There is, however, a fairly significant disadvantage.
(a)

Preference share capital is not as tax efficient as debt capital, as dividends paid are not tax
deductible, whereas interest on debt is.

5 Islamic finance

Mar/Jun 16, Mar/Jun 18

Islamic finance is finance that is compliant with Sharia'a law. Islamic finance has gone through an
exceptional growth period in recent years. The number of fully Sharia'a compliant banks continues to
increase worldwide and Sharia'a compliant financial products are not only offered by Islamic banks but
also by conventional banks using specific distribution channels. The term 'conventional' is used to identify
the financial institutions that have formed part of the financial infrastructure for a long time and are not
specifically based on Islamic principles.

5.1 Wealth creation through trade and investment
FAST FORWARD

Islamic finance transactions are based on the concept of sharing risk and reward between the investor
and the user of funds.

The object of an Islamic finance undertaking is not simply the pursuit of profit, but that the economic
benefits of the enterprise should extend to goals such as social welfare and full employment. Making
profits by lending alone and the charging of interest is forbidden under Sharia'a law. The business of
trading goods and investment in Sharia'a acceptable enterprises form the core of Islamic finance.
Following the ethics of Sharia'a is important for businesses. The ethical framework recognises that capital
has a cost associated with it and is in favour of wealth generation. However, making money with money
is deemed immoral, and wealth should be generated via trade or trade-based investments.
Financial transactions are strongly based on the sharing of risk and reward between the provider of funds
(the investor) and the user of funds (the entrepreneur).
Conventional banks aim to profit by accepting money deposits in return for the payment of interest and
then lending money out in return for the payment of a higher level of interest. Islamic finance does not
permit the use of interest and invests under arrangements which share the profits and losses of the
enterprises. The Islamic bank arranges their business in such a way that the bank's profitability is closely
tied to that of the client. The bank stands to take profit or make loss in line with the projects they are
financing and as such must be more involved in the investment decision-making.

5.2 Riba
FAST FORWARD

12/13

Riba (interest) is forbidden in Islamic finance.
Riba is generally interpreted as the predetermined interest collected by a lender, which the lender receives
over and above the principal amount it has lent out. The Quranic ban on riba is absolute. Riba can be
viewed as unacceptable from three different perspectives, as outlined below.



For the borrower

Riba creates unfairness for the borrower when the enterprise makes a profit which is less than the
interest payment, turning their profit into a loss.


For the lender

Riba creates unfairness for the lender in high inflation environments when the returns are likely to
be below the rate of inflation.


For the economy

Riba can result in inefficient allocation of available resources in the economy and may contribute to
instability of the system. In an interest-based economy, capital is directed to the borrower with the
highest creditworthiness rather than the borrower who would make the most efficient use of the
capital.

5.3 Islamic finance contracts
This section develops the discussion of Islamic finance to include the most commonly used financial
arrangements which offer suitable Sharia'a compliant financial services. Forms of contract include:






Mudaraba – a partnership contract
Musharaka – a form of equity where a partnership exists and profits and losses are shared
Murabaha – a form of credit sale
Ijara – a form of lease
Sukuk – similar to a bond

Unlike conventional banking where a division may exist between the lender of funds and the risks and
actions of the party using the funds, Islamic finance will require that an active role is played in the use of
the asset by the fund provider and that risks and rewards be shared. Instruments such as those listed
above have varied forms and may be applied carefully to offer services comparable to those offered by
conventional banks.

5.4 Mudaraba contract

6/12

A mudaraba transaction is a partnership transaction in which only one of the partners (the rab al mal)
contributes capital, and the other (the mudarib) contributes skill and expertise. The contributor of capital
has no right to interfere in the day to day operations of the business. Due to the fact that one of the
partners is running the business and the other is solely providing capital, the investor has to rely heavily
on the mudarib, their ability to manage the business and their honesty when it comes to profit share
payments.
Mudaraba transactions are particularly suited to private equity investments or for clients depositing money
with a bank.

5.4.1 The roles of and the returns received by the rab al mal and mudarib under a
mudaraba contract


Capital injection

The investor provides capital for the project or company. Generally, an investor will not provide any
capital unless a clearly defined business plan is presented to them. In this structure, the investor
provides 100% of the capital.


Skill and expertise

The business manager's contribution to the partnership is their skill and expertise in the chosen
industry or area.


Profit and loss

Any profits will be shared between the partners according to the ratios agreed in the original
contract. Any losses are solely attributable to the investor due to the fact that they are the sole
provider of all capital to the project. In the event of a loss, the business manager does not receive
any compensation (mudarib share) for their efforts. The only exception to this is when the business
manager has been negligent, in which case they become liable for the total loss.
The investor in a mudaraba transaction is only liable to the extent of the capital they have provided. As a
result, the business manager cannot commit the business for any sum which is over and above the capital
provided.
The mudaraba contract can usually be terminated at any time by either of the parties giving a reasonable
notice. Typically, conditions governing termination are included in the contract so that any damage to the
business or project is eliminated in the event that the investor would like to take their equity out of the
venture.
The rab al mal has no right to interfere with the operations of the business, meaning this situation is
similar to an equity investment on a stock exchange.

5.5 Musharaka partnership contract
Musharaka transactions are typically suitable for investments in business ventures or specific business
projects, and need to consist of at least two parties, each of which is known as musharik. It is widely used
in equity financing.

Project or
Enterprise

Once the contract has been agreed between the partners, the process can be broken down into the
following two main components.
(a)

All partners bring a share of the capital as well as expertise to the business or project. The partners
do not have to provide equal amounts of capital or equal amounts of expertise.

(b)

Any profits will be shared between the partners according to the ratios agreed in the original
contract. To the contrary, any losses that the project might incur are distributed to the partners
strictly in proportion to capital contributions. Although profits can be distributed in any proportion
by mutual consent, it is not permissible to fix a lump sum profit for any single partner.

This transaction is similar to venture capital, for example a management buyout, where both parties
contribute both capital and expertise. The venture capitalist will want board representation and therefore
provides expertise and they will also want management to provide capital to demonstrate their
commitment.

5.6 Murabaha contract
Instruments with predictable returns are typically favoured by banks and their regulators since the reliance
on third-party profit calculations is eliminated.
A murabaha transaction is a deferred payment sale or an instalment credit sale and is mostly used for
the purchase of goods for immediate delivery on deferred payment terms. In its most basic form, this
transaction involves the seller and buyer of a good, as can be seen below.
Simple murabaha structure
1. Deliver goods today
Seller

Buyer

2. Pay for goods later

As part of the contract between the buyer and the seller, the price of the goods, the mark-up, the delivery
date and payment date are agreed. The sale of the goods is immediate, against future payment. The buyer
has full knowledge of the price and quality of goods they buy. In addition, the buyer is also aware of the
exact amount of mark-up they pay for the convenience of paying later. In the context of trading, the
advantage to the buyer is that they can use the goods to generate a profit in their business and
subsequently use the profit to repay the original seller.
The underlying asset can vary, and can include raw materials and goods for resale.
Sharia'a prescribes that certain conditions are required for a sales contract (which include murabaha
contracts) to exist.


The object in the contract must actually exist and be owned by the seller.



The object is offered for a price and both object and price are accepted (the price should be within
fair market range).



The object must have a value.



The object in question and its exchange may not be prohibited by Sharia'a.

wPart E

Business finance

12: Sources of finance

257



The buyer in the contract has the right to demand that the object is of suitable quality and is not
defective.

A bank can provide finance to a business in a murabaha transaction as follows.


The manager of the business identifies an asset that the business wants to buy.



The bank agrees to buy the asset, and to resell it to the business at an agreed (fixed) price, higher
than the original purchase price of the asset.



The bank will pay for the asset immediately but agrees to payment from the business under a
deferred payment arrangement (murabaha).



The business therefore obtains the asset 'now' and pays for it later. This is similar in effect to
arranging a bank loan to purchase the asset, but it is compliant with Sharia'a law.

5.6.1 The differences between a murabaha sale and a loan of money
Murabaha is in many ways similar in its nature to a loan; however, there are key characteristics which
must be present in a murabaha contract which distinguish it.


The goods for which the financing is being arranged must effectively be owned by the financing
company.



Penalties should not be charged for late payment which would profit the lender. (Extensions are
permissible but not for additional fees or charges.)

5.7 Ijara contract
An ijara transaction is the Islamic equivalent of a lease where one party (lessor) allows another party
(lessee) to use their asset against the payment of a rental fee.
Not every asset is suitable for leasing. The asset needs to be tangible, non-perishable, valuable, identifiable
and quantifiable.
With an ijara the lessor is the owner of the asset and incurs all risk associated with ownership. While the
lessee bears the responsibility for wear and tear, day to day maintenance and damage, the lessor is
responsible for major maintenance and insurance. Due to the fact that the lessee is using the asset on a
daily basis, they are often in a better position to determine maintenance requirements, and are generally
appointed by the lessor as an agent to ensure all maintenance is carried out. In addition, the lessee is, in
some cases, similarly appointed as agent for the lessor to insure the asset.
In the event of a total loss of the asset, the lessee is no longer obliged to pay the future periodic rentals.

5.8 Islamic bond market – sukuk
From the viewpoint of Islam, conventional bonds have two major drawbacks and as a result are prohibited.
Firstly, they pay interest, and secondly there is generally no underlying asset.
Unlike conventional bonds, sukuk are normally linked to an underlying tangible asset. The ownership of
the underlying asset is transferred to the holder of the sukuk certificates together with all ownership
benefits and risks. This gives sukuk characteristics of both equity and bonds. Sukuk currently issued have
a shorter term than conventional bonds and are typically three to five years.
The sukuk holder owns a proportional share of the underlying asset and the income that it generates, and
has a financial right to the revenues generated by the asset. However, as mentioned before, the holder is
also subject to ownership risk, which means that they are exposed to any risk and potential losses
associated with the share of the underlying asset. Conventional bonds, on the other hand, remain part of
the issuer's financial liability.
The position of a manager in a sukuk is fundamentally different to that of a manager in a company issuing
bonds. When a sukuk manager sells the assets to investors to raise capital, the management of the assets
remains the manager's responsibility. The sukuk manager is responsible for managing the assets on
behalf of the sukuk holders. The result of this relationship is that holders will have the right to dismiss the
manager if they feel that this is appropriate.
258

12: Sources of finance

Part E Business finance

This is different to the relationship between the holders of conventional bonds and bond issuers. In this
situation the issuing company is responsible for fulfilling the terms of the bond, such as paying coupons
and principle, but holders of the bonds have little power to influence the actions of the issuing companies.

There is an underlying tangible asset that the sukuk holder shares in
the risk and rewards of ownership. This gives the sukuk properties
of equity finance as well as debt finance.

Case Study
Islamic finance 8 September 2014
Neither a borrower nor a lender be. Polonius would have approved of sukuk, instruments which provide a
return but do not technically pay interest. As Goldman Sachs prepares to borrow via sukuk for the first
time, Islamic financing could soon hit the mainstream. Britain has already issued sukuk and other
non-Muslim countries look set to follow. One problem: the Islamic academics who interpret Sharia'a law
have their focus far above the bottom line.
Goldman understands how this can happen. In 2011 it had to scrap a $2bn sukuk issue after some Islamic
scholars said that its sukuk was not compliant with Sharia'a, which forbids charging interest because it is
considered to be usury. Furthermore, the workarounds to meet the rules can be complicated. To comply
with Sharia'a a sukuk issuer would instead pay a fixed rent on its own real estate assets to the sukuk
holders, rather than typical interest, and at maturity buy back the property – a sale and leaseback
structure.
For agnostic capitalists the customer is always right, even if religion must sometimes provide the
guidelines. Global sukuk issuance in the first half of 2014 rose 6% to $66bn, according to the International
Islamic Finance Centre, on track to beat its 2012 record of $140bn (up 50% from a decade ago). Global
companies are keen to tap the new sources of wealth in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Ernst & Young
predicts that Islamic banking will grow to $3.4tn by 2018, an eightfold increase since 2010.

This time it might all go well for Goldman, though Sharia'a compliance risks remain. Demand for sukuk is
on the rise. Note that Britain attracted orders of £2bn for a £200m issue in June. Global banks, such as
Goldman, will want to persuade more clients to borrow via the fast-growing market. But these banks
might first wish to issue some of their own sukuk, while also heeding old Polonius' advice.

chapter we will consider internal finance in the form of surplus cash.
There is a clear link between financing decisions and the wealth of a company's
shareholders. Dividend policy plays a big part in a company's relations with its
equity shareholders, and a company must consider how the stock market will

Exam guide

1 Internal sources of finance
FAST FORWARD

Internal sources of finance include retained cash and increasing working capital efficiency.

1.1 Retained cash
Retained cash is surplus cash that has not been needed for operating costs, interest payments, tax
liabilities, asset replacement or cash dividends. For many businesses, the cash needed to finance
investments will be available because the cash the business has made have been retained within the
business rather than paid out as dividends. We emphasised in Chapter 1 that this interaction of
investment, financing and dividend policy is the most important issue facing many businesses.
Retained cash belongs to shareholders and are classed as equity financing.
A company may have substantial retained profits in its statement of financial position but no cash in the
bank and therefore will not be able to finance investment from retained cash.

1.1.1 Advantages of using retained cash
(a)

Retained cash is a flexible source of finance; companies are not tied to specific amounts or
specific repayment patterns.

(b)

Using retained cash does not involve a change in the pattern of shareholdings and no dilution of
control.

(c)

Retained cash has no issue costs.

1.1.2 Disadvantages of using retained cash

266

(a)

Shareholders may be sensitive to the loss of dividends that will result from retention for
reinvestment, rather than paying dividends.

(b)

Not so much a disadvantage as a misconception, that retaining profits is a cost-free method of
obtaining funds. There is an opportunity cost in that if dividends were paid, the cash received could
be invested by shareholders to earn a return.

1.2 Increasing working capital management efficiency
It is important not to forget that an internal source of finance is the savings that can be generated from
more efficient management of trade receivables, inventory, cash and trade payables. As we saw in Part C
of this Study Text, efficient working capital management can reduce bank overdraft and interest charges
as well as increasing cash reserves.

2 Dividend policy
FAST FORWARD

12/14, 9/16

Retained cash is the most important single source of finance for companies, and financial managers
should take account of the proportion of cash that are retained as opposed to being paid as dividends.
Companies generally smooth out dividend payments by adjusting only gradually to changes in earnings:
large fluctuations might undermine investors' confidence.
The dividends a company pays may be treated as a signal to investors. A company needs to take account
of different clienteles of shareholders in deciding what dividends to pay.
For any company, the amount of cash retained within the business has a direct impact on the amount of
dividends, because this cash could have been paid as a dividend.
A company must restrict its self-financing through retained cash because shareholders should be paid a
reasonable dividend, in line with realistic expectations, even if the directors would rather keep the funds
for reinvesting. At the same time, a company that is looking for extra funds will not be expected by
investors (such as banks) to pay generous dividends, nor over-generous salaries to owner-directors.
The dividend policy of a business affects the total shareholder return and therefore shareholder wealth
(see Chapter 1).

2.1 Dividend payments
Shareholders normally have the power to vote to reduce the size of the dividend at the Annual General
Meeting, but not the power to increase the dividend. The directors of the company are therefore in a
strong position with regard to shareholders when it comes to determining dividend policy. For practical
purposes, shareholders will usually be obliged to accept the dividend policy that has been decided on by
the directors, or otherwise to sell their shares.

2.2 Factors influencing dividend policy
When deciding on the dividends to pay out to shareholders, one of the main considerations of the
directors will be the amount of cash they wish to retain to meet financing needs.
As well as future financing requirements, the decision on how much of a company's profits should be
retained, and how much paid out to shareholders, will be influenced by:
(a)

The need to remain profitable. Dividends are paid out of profits, and an unprofitable company
cannot go on indefinitely paying dividends out of retained profits made in the past.

(b)

The law on distributable profits. Companies legislation may make companies bound to pay
dividends solely out of accumulated net realised profits, as in the UK.

(c)

The government may impose direct restrictions on the amount of dividends that companies can
pay. (For example, this happened in the UK in the 1960s as part of a prices and income policy.)

(d)

Any dividend restraints that might be imposed by loan agreements and covenants. A loan
covenant may restrict the amount of dividends that the company can pay, because this will provide
protection for the lender.

(e)

The effect of inflation. There is also the need to retain some profit within the business just to
maintain its operating capability unchanged.

w

Part E Business finance

13: Dividend policy

267

(f)

The company's gearing level. If the company wants extra finance, the sources of funds used
should strike a balance between equity and debt finance.

(g)

The company's liquidity position. Dividends are a cash payment, and a company must have
enough cash to pay the dividends it declares.

(h)

The need to repay debt in the near future. The company must have enough cash to pay debts as
they fall due.

(i)

The ease with which the company could raise extra finance from sources other than retained cash.
Small companies which find it hard to raise finance might have to rely more heavily on retained
cash than large companies.

(j)

The signalling effect of dividends to shareholders and the financial markets in general. See below
for more details.

2.3 Dividends as a signal to investors
The ultimate objective in any financial management decisions is to maximise shareholders' wealth. This
wealth is basically represented by the current market value of the company, which should largely be
determined by the cash flows arising from the investment decisions taken by management.
Although the market would like to value shares on the basis of underlying cash flows on the company's
projects, such information is not readily available to investors. But the directors do have this
information. The dividend declared can be interpreted as a signal from directors to shareholders about the
strength of underlying project cash flows.
Investors usually expect a consistent dividend policy from the company, with stable dividends each year
or, even better, steady dividend growth. A large rise or fall in dividends in any year can have a marked
effect on the company's share price. Stable dividends or steady dividend growth are usually needed for
share price stability. A cut in dividends may be treated by investors as signalling that the future prospects
of the company are weak. Thus the dividend which is paid acts, possibly without justification, as a signal
of the future prospects of the company.
The signalling effect of a company's dividend policy may also be used by management of a company
which faces a possible takeover. The dividend level might be increased as a defence against the takeover:
investors may take the increased dividend as a signal of improved future prospects, thus driving the share
price higher and making the company more expensive for a potential bidder to take over.

2.4 Theories of dividend policy
2.4.1 Residual theory
A 'residual' theory of dividend policy can be summarised as follows.



If a company can identify projects with positive NPVs, it should invest in them.
Only when these investment opportunities are exhausted should dividends be paid.

Dividends should therefore be the amount of after-tax profits left over (the 'residual' amount) after setting
aside money to invest in all viable business opportunities.

2.4.2 Traditional view
The 'traditional' view of dividend policy, implicit in our earlier discussion, is to focus on the effects of
dividends and dividend expectations on share price. The price of a share depends on both current
dividends and expectations of future dividend growth, given shareholders' required rate of return.

2.4.3 Irrelevancy theory
In contrast to the traditional view, Modigliani and Miller (M&M) proposed that in a perfect capital market,
shareholders are indifferent between dividends and capital gains, and the value of a company is
determined solely by the 'earning power' of its assets and investments (quoted in: Watson and Head,
2013, p.320).

M&M argued that if a company with investment opportunities decides to pay a dividend so that retained
cash are insufficient to finance all its investments, the shortfall in funds will be made up by obtaining
additional funds from outside sources. As a result of obtaining outside finance instead of using retained
cash:
Loss of value in existing shares = Amount of dividend paid
In answer to criticisms that certain shareholders will show a preference either for high dividends or for
capital gains, M&M argued that if a company pursues a consistent dividend policy, 'each corporation
would tend to attract to itself a clientele consisting of those preferring its particular payout ratio, but one
clientele would be entirely as good as another in terms of the valuation it would imply for the firm' (quoted
in: Watson and Head, 2013, p.320).
Note that M&M's view assumes that there are no transaction costs incurred when selling shares.

2.4.4 The case in favour of the relevance of dividend policy (and against M&M's
views)
There are strong arguments against M&M's view that dividend policy is irrelevant as a means of affecting
shareholders' wealth.

Exam focus
point

(a)

M&M's view assumes that there is no personal or corporation tax. However, differing rates of
taxation on dividends and capital gains can create a preference among investors for either a high
dividend or high earnings retention (for capital growth).

(b)

Dividend retention will often be preferred by companies in a period of capital rationing.

(c)

Due to imperfect markets and the possible difficulties of selling shares easily at a fair price,
shareholders might need high dividends in order to have funds to invest in opportunities outside
the company.

(d)

Markets are not perfect. Because of transaction costs on the sale of shares, investors who want
some cash from their investments will prefer to receive dividends rather than to sell some of their
shares to get the cash they want.

(e)

Information available to shareholders is imperfect, and they are not aware of the future investment
plans and expected profits of their company. Even if management were to provide them with profit
forecasts, these forecasts would not necessarily be accurate or believable.

(f)

Perhaps the strongest argument against the M&M's view is that shareholders will tend to prefer a
current dividend to future capital gains (or deferred dividends) because the future is more
uncertain.

In the real world, dividends do seem to matter which suggests that the case in favour of the relevance of
dividend policy is a strong one. Note that this area could be a discussion part of a section C question and
was tested in this way in the specimen (pilot) exam.

Question

Dividend policy

Ochre is a company that is still managed by the two individuals who set it up 12 years ago. In the current
year the company was launched on the stock market. Previously, all the shares had been owned by its two
founders and certain employees. Now, 40% of the shares are in the hands of the investing public. The
company's profit growth and dividend policy are set out below. Will a continuation of the same dividend
policy as in the past be suitable now that the company is quoted on the stock market?

The company appears to have pursued a dividend policy of paying out half of after-tax profits in dividend.
This policy is only suitable when a company achieves a stable EPS or steady EPS growth. Investors do not
like a fall in dividend from one year to the next, and the fall in dividend per share in the current year is
likely to be unpopular and to result in a fall in the share price.
The company would probably serve its shareholders better by paying a dividend of at least 15c per share,
possibly more, in the current year, even though the dividend as a percentage of profit would then be
higher.

2.5 Scrip dividends
Key term

12/14

A scrip dividend is a dividend paid by the issue of additional company shares, rather than by cash.
When the directors of a company would prefer to retain funds within the business but consider that they
must pay at least a certain amount of dividend, they might offer equity shareholders the choice of a cash
dividend or a scrip dividend. Each shareholder would decide separately which to take.
With enhanced scrip dividends, the value of the shares offered is much greater than the cash alternative,
giving investors an incentive to choose the shares.

2.5.1 Advantages of scrip dividends
(a)

They can preserve a company's cash position if a substantial number of shareholders take up the
share option.

(b)

Investors may be able to obtain tax advantages if dividends are in the form of shares.

(c)

Investors looking to expand their holding can do so without incurring the transaction costs of
buying more shares.

(d)

A small scrip dividend issue will not dilute the share price significantly. However, if cash is not
offered as an alternative, empirical evidence suggests that the share price will tend to fall.

(e)

A share issue will decrease the company's gearing, and may therefore enhance its borrowing
capacity.

2.5.2 Disadvantages of scrip dividends
(a)

Assuming that dividend per share is maintained or increased, the total cash paid as a dividend will
increase.

(b)

Scrip dividends may be seen as a negative signal by the market ie the company is experiencing
cash flow issues.

2.6 Share repurchase
FAST FORWARD

270

12/14

Purchase by a company of its own shares can take place for various reasons and must be in accordance
with any requirements of legislation.

13: Dividend policy

Part E Business finance

In many countries companies have the right to buy back shares from shareholders who are willing to sell
them, subject to certain conditions.
For a smaller company with few shareholders, the reason for buying back the company's own shares may
be that there is no immediate willing purchaser at a time when a shareholder wishes to sell shares.
For a public company, share repurchase could provide a way of withdrawing from the share market and
'going private'.
Public companies with a large amount of surplus cash may offer to repurchase (and then cancel) some
shares from its shareholders. A reason for this is to find a way of offering cash returns to investors
without increasing dividend payments. Higher dividend payments would affect investor expectations about
future dividends and dividend growth, whereas share buybacks would not affect dividend expectations at
all. In addition, by reducing the number of shares in issue, the company should be able to increase the
earnings per share (EPS) for the remaining shares.

2.6.1 Benefits of a share repurchase scheme
(a)

Finding a use for surplus cash, which may be a 'dead asset'.

(b)

Increase in earnings per share through a reduction in the number of shares in issue. This should
lead to a higher share price than would otherwise be the case, and the company should be able to
increase dividend payments on the remaining shares in issue.

(c)

Increase in gearing. Repurchase of a company's own shares allows debt to be substituted for
equity, so raising gearing. This will be of interest to a company wanting to increase its gearing
without increasing its total long-term funding.

(d)

Readjustment of the company's equity base to more appropriate levels, for a company whose
business is in decline.

(e)

Possibly preventing a takeover or enabling a quoted company to withdraw from the stock market.

2.6.2 Drawbacks of a share repurchase scheme
(a)

It can be hard to arrive at a price that will be fair both to the vendors and to any shareholders who
are not selling shares to the company.

(b)

A repurchase of shares could be seen as an admission that the company cannot make better use
of the funds than the shareholders.

(c)

Some shareholders may suffer from being taxed on a capital gain following the purchase of their
shares rather than receiving dividend income.

Case Study
It would be silly to say the Next empire – expanded spectacularly over the past 20 years via the catalogue
and online directory business – is crumbling. Next may be overreliant on consumer credit – and the
clothes may be dowdier since the departure of the design guru Christos Angelides in 2014 – but most of
the pressures described by Wolfson (Next's CEO) apply to the majority of mass-market clothing retailers.
Pre-tax profits of £792m this year will still mean Next makes substantially more profit than Marks &
Spencer. The company also has less debt than M&S.
Yet there was a detail in Wednesday's trading update that should alarm the Next fanclub. For the time being,
Wolfson is giving up on share buy-backs and will hand surplus cash – expected to be £255m – £345m – to
shareholders via special dividends next year.
At other companies, one might applaud the prudence. But Wolfson is the acknowledged maestro of the
buy-back game. Next buys its shares when they are cheap according to a return-on-capital model Wolfson
has refined over the years; and it refuses to buy when the formula says they are expensive, as when the
price rose to £81 in late 2015.

Part E Business finance

13: Dividend policy

271

The policy sounds like mere common sense, but the logic escapes too many companies who buy at any
price whenever they have a few quid on hand. The relevant point now is that Next no longer stands at £81.
After Wednesday's 14% tumble, it's almost at £41. You'd expect Wolfson to be itching to grab a few at
almost half the old share price. But he's not. If Next is not buying its shares when it can afford to do so,
it's hard to see why others should rush in.
Nothing has been ruled out permanently, it should be said: the statement allowed the possibility of
buy-backs if trading turns out to be better than expected. But the shift in policy – attributed to “the
exceptional levels of uncertainty in the clothing sector” and the lack of visibility on “the approach the UK
government will be taking to Brexit” – looks significant.

Chapter Roundup


Internal sources of finance include retained cash and increasing working capital efficiency.



Retained cash are the most important single source of finance for companies, and financial managers
should take account of the proportion of cash that are retained as opposed to being paid as dividends.



Companies generally smooth out dividend payments by only gradually adjusting to changes in earnings:
large fluctuations might undermine investors' confidence.



The dividends a company pays may be treated as a signal to investors. A company needs to take account
of different clienteles of shareholders in deciding what dividends to pay.



Purchase by a company of its own shares can take place for various reasons and must be in accordance

Introduction
In this chapter we examine the concept of the cost of capital, which can be
used as a discount rate in evaluating the investments of an organisation.
We firstly base cost of equity calculations on the dividend valuation model.
We then look at a way of establishing the cost of equity that takes risk into
account: the capital asset pricing model.
We then calculate the cost of capital for a range of debt instruments and then
estimate the cost of capital.

Exam guide
In the exam you may be asked to calculate the weighted average cost of capital and its component costs,
either as a separate sub-question, or as part of a larger question, most likely an investment appraisal.
Remember that questions won't just involve calculations; you may be asked to discuss the problems with
the methods of calculation you've used or the relevance of the costs of capital to investment decisions.

1 Cost of capital
FAST FORWARD

The cost of capital is the rate of return that the enterprise must pay to satisfy the providers of funds, and
it reflects the riskiness of providing funds.
Performance objective 9 requires you to 'advise on the appropriateness and cost of different sources of
finance'. This chapter covers the cost of finance.

1.1 Aspects of the cost of capital
The cost of capital has two aspects to it.
(a)
(b)

The cost of funds that a company raises and uses
The return that investors expect to be paid for putting funds into the company

It is therefore the minimum return that a company should make on its own investments, to earn the cash
flows out of which investors can be paid their return.
The cost of capital can therefore be measured by studying the returns required by investors. The cost of
capital can then be used to derive a discount rate for DCF analysis and investment appraisal.
Each form of capital has its own cost. For example, equity has a cost and each bank loan or bond issue
has a different cost. A company must make sufficient returns from its investments to satisfy the
requirements for return of all the different finance providers.

1.2 The cost of capital as an opportunity cost of finance
The cost of capital is an opportunity cost of finance, because it is the minimum return that investors
require. If they do not get this return, they will transfer some or all of their investment somewhere else.
Here are two examples.
(a)

If a bank offers to lend money to a company, the interest rate it charges is the yield that the bank
wants to receive from investing in the company, because it can get just as good a return from
lending the money to someone else. In other words, the interest rate is the opportunity cost of
lending for the bank.

(b)

When shareholders invest in a company, the returns that they can expect must be sufficient to
persuade them not to sell some or all of their shares and invest the money somewhere else. The
yield on the shares is therefore the opportunity cost to the shareholders of not investing
somewhere else.

1.3 The cost of capital and risk
The cost of capital can be analysed into three elements.
Risk-free rate of return +
Premium for business risk +
Premium for financial risk
COST OF CAPITAL
(a)

Risk-free rate of return
This is the return which would be required from an investment if it were completely free from risk.
Typically, a risk-free yield is the yield on government securities.

(b)

Premium for business risk
This is an increase in the required rate of return due to the existence of uncertainty about the
future and about a firm's business prospects. The actual returns from an investment may not be
as high as they are expected to be. Business risk will be higher for some firms than for others, and
some types of project undertaken by a firm may be more risky than other types of project that it
undertakes.

(c)

Premium for financial risk
This relates to the danger of high debt levels (high gearing). The higher the gearing of a company's
capital structure, the greater will be the financial risk to ordinary shareholders, and this should be
reflected in a higher risk premium and therefore a higher cost of capital.

wPart E

Business finance

14: The cost of capital

279

Because different companies are in different types of business (varying business risk) and have different
capital structures (varying financial risk) the cost of capital applied to one company may differ radically
from the cost of capital of another.

1.4 The relative costs of sources of finance
The cost of debt (the rate a firm pays on its current loans, loan notes and other debts) is likely to be lower
than the cost of equity (the return paid to its shareholders). This is because debt is less risky from the
debtholders' viewpoint. In the event of liquidation, the creditor hierarchy dictates the priority of claims
and debt finance is paid off before equity. This makes debt a safer investment than equity and hence debt
investors demand a lower rate of return than equity investors.
Debt interest is also corporation tax deductible (unlike equity dividends), making it even cheaper to a
taxpaying company. Arrangement costs are usually lower on debt finance than on equity finance and once
again, unlike equity arrangement costs, they are also tax deductible.

Sep/Dec 15, Mar/Jun 16

Investors will require a higher return to compensate for risk. This means that the cheapest type of finance
is debt (especially if secured) and the most expensive type of finance is equity (ordinary shares). This
risk-return relationship is sometimes referred to as the creditor hierarchy.

2 Dividend growth model
FAST FORWARD

Mar/Jun 16, 12/16, Sep/Dec 17

The dividend growth model can be used to estimate a cost of equity, on the assumption that the market
value of share is directly related to the expected future dividends from the shares.

2.1 The cost of ordinary share capital
New funds from equity shareholders are obtained either from new issues of shares or from retained
earnings. Both of these sources of funds have a cost.
(a)
(b)

Shareholders will not be prepared to provide funds for a new issue of shares unless the return on
their investment is sufficiently attractive.
Retained earnings also have a cost. This is an opportunity cost, the dividend forgone by
shareholders.

The cost of equity can be estimated using several different methods or models. These include the dividend
valuation model, the dividend growth model and the capital asset pricing model. Each method is a way of
estimating the cost of equity, so in theory they should produce identical answers. However, as each
involves different sources of data and estimates, in practice they would probably result in differing
estimates for the cost of equity.

2.2 The dividend valuation model
If we begin by ignoring share issue costs, the cost of equity, both for new issues and retained earnings,
could be estimated by means of a dividend valuation model, on the assumption that the market value of
shares is directly related to expected future dividends on the shares.
Remember the formula for a perpetuity:

Where c is the constant cash flow every period, and r is the cost of capital.
If the future dividend per share is expected to be constant in amount, the present value of future dividends
is a perpetuity. It is no surprise, then, that the ex dividend share price is calculated by the formula:
P0

d is the annual dividend per share, starting at year 1 and then continuing annually in perpetuity
P0 is the ex-dividend share price (the price of a share where the share's new owner is not entitled
to the dividend that is soon to be paid)
We shall look at the dividend valuation model again in Chapter 18, in the context of valuation of shares.

2.3 Example: Dividend valuation model
Cygnus has a dividend cover ratio of 4.0 times and expects zero growth in dividends. The company has
one million $1 ordinary shares in issue and the market capitalisation (value) of the company is $50m.
After-tax profits for next year are expected to be $20m.
What is the cost of equity capital?

Solution
Total dividends = 20 million/4 = $5m.
ke = 5/50 = 10%

2.4 The dividend growth model
Shareholders will normally expect dividends to increase year by year and not to remain constant in
perpetuity. The fundamental theory of share values states that the market price of a share is the present
value of the discounted future cash flows of revenues from the share, so the market value given an
expected constant annual growth in dividends would be:
P0 =

d0 (1 g)

d0 (1 g)2

(1 ke )

(1 ke )2

where P0
d0
ke
g

...

is the current market price (ex div)
is the current net dividend
is the cost of equity capital
is the expected annual growth in dividend payments

and both ke and g are expressed as proportions.
It is often convenient to assume a constant expected dividend growth rate in perpetuity. The formula
above then simplifies to:
P0

d0 (1 g)
d1
=
(k e g)
(ke g)

Rearranging this, we get a formula for the ordinary shareholders' cost of capital.

2.4.1 Estimating the growth rate
There are two methods for estimating the growth rate that you need to be familiar with.
Firstly, the future growth rate can be predicted from an analysis of the growth in dividends over the past
few years.

Dividends have risen from $150,000 in 20X1 to $262,350 in 20X5. The increase represents four years'
growth. (Check that you can see that there are four years' growth, and not five years' growth, in the table.)
The (geometric) average growth rate, g, may be calculated as follows.
Dividend in 20X1

(1 + g)4 = Dividend in 20X5
(1 g) 4 =

The growth rate over the last four years is assumed to be expected by shareholders into the indefinite
future. If the company is financed entirely by equity and there are 1,000,000 shares in issue, each with a
market value of $3.35 ex div, the cost of equity, Ke, is:
d0 (1 g)
0.26235(1.15)

2.4.2 Gordon's growth approximation
Alternatively, the growth rate can be estimated using Gordon's growth approximation. The rate of growth
in dividends is sometimes expressed theoretically as:

Formula to
learn

g = br
Where g is the annual growth rate in dividends
b is the proportion of profits that are retained
r is the rate of return on new investments
So, if a company retains 65% of its earnings for capital investment projects it has identified and these
projects are expected to have an average return of 8%:
g = br = 65%

8 = 5.2%

2.5 Weaknesses of the dividend growth model
(a)

The model does not explicitly incorporate risk.

(b)

Dividends do not grow smoothly in reality, so g is only an approximation.

(c)

The model fails to take capital gains into account; however, it is argued that a change of share
ownership does not affect the present value of the dividend stream.

(d)

No allowance is made for the effects of taxation although the model can be modified to incorporate
tax.

(e)

It assumes there are no issue costs for new shares.

(f)

It does not produce meaningful results where no dividend is paid (if d is zero, Ke is 0).

3 Capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
FAST FORWARD

12/14, 6/15, 12/16

The capital asset pricing model can be used to calculate a cost of equity and incorporates risk.
The CAPM is based on a comparison of the systematic risk of individual investments with the risks of all
shares in the market.

3.1 Portfolio theory
Different investments react differently to events in the market. Portfolio theory suggests that investors can
reduce the total risk on their investments by diversifying their portfolio of investments. Because each
investment is exposed to different risks, investors should consider how the value of each of their
investments changes in relation to every other investment when making new investments.
Provided that the investor diversifies their investments in a suitably wide portfolio, the investments which
perform well and those which perform badly should tend to cancel each other out, and much risk can be
diversified away. In the same way, a company which invests in a number of projects will find that some do
well and some do badly, but taking the whole portfolio of investments, average returns should turn out
much as expected.
A concept in portfolio theory that is used in the capital asset pricing model is the market portfolio. The
market portfolio is a portfolio of investments, excluding risk-free investments, that represents a basket of
risky investments each weighted in proportion to their overall size. Usually 'risky investments' is taken to
mean stock market investments. An investor in a portfolio of investments that reflects the market as a
whole should therefore expect returns that are equal to the average returns for the market as a whole
(excluding returns on risk-free investments). The return available on a market 'index' measure like the
FTSE 100 in the UK or the Dow Jones in the US is often used to measure this.

3.2 Systematic risk and unsystematic risk
FAST FORWARD

The total risk involved in holding securities (shares) divides into risk specific to the company
(unsystematic) and risk due to variations in market activity (systematic).
Unsystematic risk can be diversified away, while systematic or market risk cannot. Investors may mix a
diversified market portfolio with risk-free assets to achieve a preferred mix of risk and return.

Whenever an investor invests in some shares, or a company invests in a new project, there will be some
risk involved. The actual return on the investment might be better or worse than that hoped for. To some
extent, risk is unavoidable (unless the investor settles for risk-free securities, such as gilts).
We have looked at how diversification reduces the risks of investment according to the portfolio theory.
However, not all risks can be diversified away.
Risks that can be diversified away are referred to as unsystematic risk. But there is another sort of risk
too. Some markets are by their very nature more risky than others. This has nothing to do with chance
variations up or down in actual returns compared with what an investor should expect. This inherent risk
– the systematic risk or market risk – cannot be diversified away. Systematic risk includes, for example,
the risk that the market crashes as a result of a global recession, war or natural catastrophe.

Key terms

Risk is the risk of variability in investment returns.
Market risk or systematic risk cannot be diversified away. Non-systematic or unsystematic risk applies
to a single investment or class of investments, and can be reduced or eliminated by diversification.

In return for accepting systematic risk, a risk-averse investor will expect to earn a return which is higher
than the return on a risk-free investment.

Exam focus
point

Common errors on this topic in exams include:


Assuming risk-averse investors wish to eliminate risk; risk-averse investors are prepared to accept
risk, in exchange for higher returns



Failing to link the risks of an investment with its returns



Mixing up systematic and unsystematic risk

3.3 Systematic risk and unsystematic risk: implications for investments
The implications of systematic risk and unsystematic risk are therefore as follows.

284

(a)

If an investor wants to avoid risk altogether, they must invest entirely in risk-free securities.

(b)

If an investor holds shares in just a few companies, there will be some unsystematic risk as well
as systematic risk in their portfolio, because they will not have spread their risk enough to diversify
away the unsystematic risk. To eliminate unsystematic risk, they must build up a well-diversified
portfolio of investments.

(c)

If an investor holds a balanced portfolio of all the stocks and shares on the stock market, they will
incur systematic risk which is exactly equal to the average systematic risk in the stock market as a
whole.

(d)

Shares in individual companies will have different systematic risk characteristics to this market
average. Some shares will be less risky and some will be more risky than the stock market average.
Similarly, some investments will be more risky and some will be less risky than a company's
'average' investments.

3.4 Systematic risk and the CAPM
FAST FORWARD

The systematic risk in individual company shares can be measured statistically, by analysing historical
returns.
The CAPM model uses a beta factor to measure a share's volatility in terms of systematic risk.
In accordance with portfolio theory, unsystematic risk is ignored in the CAPM, as it is assumed
unsystematic risk can be diversified away.
The CAPM is mainly concerned with how systematic risk is measured, and how systematic risk affects
required returns and share prices. Systematic risk is measured using beta factors.

Key term

Beta factor is the measure of the systematic risk of a security relative to the average market portfolio. The
higher the beta factor, the more sensitive the security is to systematic risk (the more volatile its returns in
response to factors that affect market returns generally).
Beta factors

1

This is the measurement of systematic risk for the stock market as a whole.

0

This is the systematic risk for risk-free investments. Returns on risk-free investments
are unaffected by market risk and variations in market returns.

Less than 1

Systematic risk is lower than for the market on average.

More than 1

Systematic risk is higher than for the market on average.

The beta factor reflects the fact that different market sectors, and individual companies within each market
sector, are exposed to different degrees of systematic risk. Supermarkets are relatively unaffected by
systematic risk, for example, so are likely to have a low beta factor. On the other hand, the banking and
tourism industries are impacted to a much greater degree by systematic risk. They will have a high beta
factor.
CAPM theory includes the following propositions.
(a)

Investors in shares require a return in excess of the risk-free rate, to compensate them for
systematic risk.

(b)

Investors should not require a premium for unsystematic risk, because this can be diversified
away by holding a wide portfolio of investments. In this, CAPM builds on portfolio theory.

(c)

Because systematic risk varies between companies, investors will require a higher return from
shares in those companies where the systematic risk is bigger.

The same propositions can be applied to capital investments by companies.
(a)

Companies will want a return on a project to exceed the risk-free rate, to compensate them for
systematic risk.

(b)

Unsystematic risk can be diversified away, and so a premium for unsystematic risk should not be
required.

(c)

Companies should want a bigger return on projects where systematic risk is greater.

3.5 Market risk and returns
Market risk (systematic risk) is the average risk of the market as a whole. Taking all the shares on a stock
market together, the total expected returns from the market will vary because of systematic risk. The
market as a whole might do well or it might do badly.

wPart E

Business finance

14: The cost of capital

285

3.6 Risk and returns from an individual security
In the same way, an individual security may offer prospects of a return of x%, but with some risk
(business risk and financial risk) attached. The return (the x%) that investors will require from the
individual security will be higher or lower than the market return, depending on whether the security's
systematic risk is greater or less than the market average. A major assumption in CAPM is that there is a
linear relationship between the return obtained from an individual security and the average return from all
securities in the market.

3.7 Example: CAPM (1)
The following information is available about the performance of an individual company's shares and the
stock market as a whole.
Individual company
Stock market as a whole
Price at start of period
105.0
480.0
Price at end of period
110.0
490.0
Dividend during period
7.6
39.2
The return on the company's shares Ri (total shareholder return) and the expected return on the 'market
portfolio' of shares E(rm) may be calculated as:
Capital gain (or loss) dividend P1 P0 D1
=
Price at start of period
P0
Ri =

(110 105) 7.6
= 12%
105

E(rm) =

(490 480) 39.2
= 10.25%
480

A statistical analysis of 'historical' returns from a security and from the 'average' market may suggest that
a linear relationship can be assumed to exist between them. A series of comparative figures could be
prepared of the return from a company's shares and the average return of the market as a whole. The
results could be drawn on a scattergraph and a 'line of best fit' drawn (using linear regression techniques)
as shown below.

This analysis would show three things.
(a)

The return from the security and the return from the market as a whole will tend to rise or fall
together.

(b)

The return from the security may be higher or lower than the market return. This is because the
systematic risk of the individual security differs from that of the market as a whole.

(c)

The scattergraph may not give a good line of best fit, unless a large number of data items are
plotted, because actual returns are affected by unsystematic risk as well as by systematic risk.

Note that returns can be negative. A share price fall represents a capital loss, which is a negative return.
The conclusion from this analysis is that individual securities will be either more or less risky than the
market average in a fairly predictable way. The measure of this relationship between market returns and
286

14: The cost of capital

Part E Business finance
w


an individual security's returns, reflecting differences in systematic risk characteristics, can be developed
into a beta factor for the individual security.

3.8 The equity risk premium
Key term

Market risk premium or equity risk premium is the difference between the expected rate of return on a
market portfolio and the risk-free rate of return over the same period.

The equity risk premium E(rm – Rf) represents the excess of market returns over those associated with
investing in risk-free assets.
The CAPM makes use of the principle that returns on shares in the market as a whole are expected to be
higher than the returns on risk-free investments. The difference between market returns and risk-free
returns is called an excess return. For example, if the return on British government stocks is 9% and
market returns are 13%, the excess return on the market's shares as a whole is 4%.
The difference between the risk-free return and the expected return on an individual security can be
measured as the excess return for the market as a whole multiplied by the security's beta factor.

3.9 The CAPM formula
The capital asset pricing model is a statement of the principles explained above. It can be stated as
follows.

Exam
formula

E(ri) = Rf + i(E(rm) – Rf)
Where E(ri) is the cost of equity capital

E(rm) is the return from the market as a whole

i

3.10 Example: CAPM (2)
Shares in Louie and Dewie have a beta of 0.9. The expected returns to the market are 10% and the risk-free
rate of return is 4%. What is the cost of equity capital for Louie and Dewie?

Solution
E(ri) = Rf + i(E(rm) – Rf)
= 4 + 0.9(10 – 4)
= 9.4%

3.11 Example: CAPM (3)
Investors have an expected rate of return of 8% from ordinary shares in Algol, which have a beta of 1.2.
The expected returns to the market are 7%.
What will be the expected rate of return from ordinary shares in Rigel, which have a beta of 1.8?

Solution
Algol:

E(ri) = Rf + i(E(rm) – Rf)
8 = Rf + 1.2(7 – Rf)
8 = Rf + 8.4 – 1.2 Rf
0.2 Rf = 0.4
Rf = 2%

3.12 Problems with applying the CAPM in practice
FAST FORWARD

Problems of CAPM include unrealistic assumptions and the required estimates being difficult to make.
(a)

The need to determine the excess return (E(rm) – Rf). Expected, rather than historical, returns
should be used, although historical returns are used in practice, since beta factors are derived from
statistical analysis of historical returns.

(b)

The need to determine the risk-free rate. A risk-free investment might be a government security.
However, interest rates vary with the term of the lending.

(c)

Errors in the statistical analysis used to calculate

(d)

Betas may also change over time and changes may not be identified quickly through historical
statistical analysis.

(e)

The CAPM is also unable to forecast returns accurately for companies with low price/earnings
ratios and to take account of seasonal 'month of the year' effects and 'day of the week' effects that
appear to influence returns on shares.

values are an issue.

Question
(a)
(b)

Beta factor

What does beta measure, and what do betas of 0.5, 1 and 1.5 mean?
What factors determine the level of beta which a company may have?

Answer
(a)

Beta measures the systematic risk of a risky investment, such as a share in a company. The total
risk of the share can be subdivided into two parts, known as systematic (or market) risk and
unsystematic (or unique) risk. The systematic risk depends on the sensitivity of the return of the
share to general economic and market factors, such as periods of boom and recession. The capital
asset pricing model shows how the return which investors expect from shares should depend only
on systematic risk, not on unsystematic risk, which can be eliminated by holding a well-diversified
portfolio.

Beta is calibrated such that the average risk of stock market investments has a beta of 1. Thus
shares with betas of 0.5 or 1.5 would have half or 1½ times the average sensitivity to market
variations respectively.

288

14: The cost of capital

Part E Business finance
w


This is reflected by higher volatility of share prices for shares with a beta of 1.5 than for those with
a beta of 0.5. For example, a 10% increase in general stock market prices would be expected to be
reflected as a 5% increase for a share with a beta of 0.5 and a 15% increase for a share with a beta
of 1.5, with a similar effect for price reductions.
(b)

The beta of a company will be the weighted average of the beta of its shares and the beta of its
debt. The beta of debt is very low, but not zero, because corporate debt bears default risk, which in
turn is dependent on the volatility of the company's cash flows.
Factors determining the beta of a company's equity shares include:
(i)

Sensitivity of the company's cash flows to economic factors, as stated above. For example
sales of new cars are more sensitive than sales of basic foods and necessities.

(ii)

The company's operating gearing. A high level of fixed costs in the company's cost
structure will cause high variations in operating profit compared with variations in sales.

(iii)

The company's financial gearing. High borrowing and interest costs will cause high
variations in equity earnings compared with variations in operating profit, increasing the
equity beta as equity returns become more variable in relation to the market as a whole.
This effect will be countered by the low beta of debt when computing the weighted average
beta of the whole company.

3.13 Dividend growth model and CAPM
The dividend growth model and CAPM will not necessarily give the same cost of equity, and in your exam
you may have to calculate the cost of equity using either, or both, models.

4 Cost of debt
FAST FORWARD

12/14, Mar/Jun 16, 12/16, Sep/Dec 17

The cost of debt is the return an enterprise must pay to its lenders.
–

For irredeemable debt, this is the (post-tax) interest as a percentage of the ex interest market
value of the loan notes (or preferred shares).

–

For redeemable debt, the cost is given by the internal rate of return of the cash flows involved
(interest and capital gain or loss at redemption).

Interest is tax deductible and this is taken into account in the calculations.

4.1 The cost of debt capital
Lenders are only willing to lend if their initial outlay of money is fully compensated by future cash inflows.
Therefore, the cost of capital is the rate at which lenders recover their initial outlay of money, and the price
of debt equals the present value of cash inflows. For the borrowing company this represents:

Exam focus
point

(a)

The cost of continuing to use the finance rather than redeem the securities at their current market
price; and

(b)

The cost of raising additional fixed interest capital if we assume that the cost of the additional
capital would be equal to the cost of that already issued. If a company has not already issued any
fixed interest capital, it may estimate the cost of doing so by making a similar calculation for
another company which is judged to be similar as regards risk.

Remember that different types of debt have different costs. The cost of a loan note will not be the same as
the cost of a bank loan.

4.2 Irredeemable debt capital
Again, remember the formula for a perpetuity: PV =

c
r

Irredeemable debt capital is a perpetuity. Rearrange the perpetuity formula and the cost of irredeemable
debt capital, paying interest i in perpetuity, and having a current ex-interest price is as follows.
P0 =

i

and kd =
Kd

4.3 Example: Cost of debt capital (1)
Lepus has issued loan notes of $100 nominal value with annual interest of 9% per year, based on the
nominal value. The current market price of the loan notes is $90. What is the cost of the loan notes?

Solution
kd = 9/90 = 10%

4.4 Example: Cost of debt capital (2)
Henryted has 12% irredeemable loan notes in issue with a nominal value of $100. The market price is $95
ex interest. Calculate the cost of capital if interest is paid half-yearly.

Solution
If interest is 12% annually, therefore 6% is payable half-yearly.

The above equation cannot be simplified, so 'r' will have to be calculated by trial and error, as an internal
rate of return (IRR).
The best trial and error figure to start with in calculating the cost of redeemable debt is to take the cost of
debt capital as if it were irredeemable and then add the annualised capital profit that will be made from the
present time to the time of redemption.

Exam focus
point

In the March/June 2016 exam, the examining team commented that the use of extreme values such as 1%
and 20% in this IRR approach (also called linear interpolation) should be discouraged as these give a poor
estimate of the cost of debt.

4.6 Example: Cost of debt capital (3)
Owen Allot has in issue 10% loan notes of a nominal value of $100. The market price is $90 ex interest.

4.7 Debt capital and taxation
The interest on debt capital is likely to be an allowable deduction for the purposes of taxation and so the
cost of debt capital and the cost of share capital are not properly comparable costs. This tax relief on
interest ought to be recognised in computations. The after-tax cost of irredeemable debt capital is:
kd net

i(1 T)
P0

Where kd net is the after-tax cost of debt capital
i

is the annual interest payment

P0

is the current market price of the debt capital ex interest (that is, after
payment of the current interest)

T

is the rate of corporation tax

Note. This is only a variant of the cost of irredeemable debt capital formula in Section 4.2.

Formula to
learn

Cost of irredeemable debt capital, paying annual net interest i(1 – T), and having a current ex-interest price
P0:
i(1 T)
kd net =
P0
Therefore if a company pays $10,000 a year interest on irredeemable loan notes with a nominal value of
$100,000 and a market price of $80,000, and the rate of tax is 30%, the cost of the debt would be:
10,000
(1 – 0.30) = 0.0875 = 8.75%
80,000

The higher the rate of tax, the greater the tax benefits in having debt finance will be compared with equity
finance. In the example above, if the rate of tax had been 50%, the cost of debt after tax would have been:
10,000
(1 – 0.50) = 0.0625 = 6.25%
80,000

Exam focus
point

Students often don't remember that debt attracts tax relief in most jurisdictions.
In the case of redeemable debt, the capital repayment is not allowable for tax. To calculate the cost of the
debt capital to include in the weighted average cost of capital, it is necessary to calculate an internal rate of
return which takes account of tax relief on the interest.

4.8 Example: Cost of debt capital (4)
(a)

A company has outstanding $660,000 of 8% loan notes on which the interest is payable annually
on 31 December. The debt is due for redemption at par on 1 January 20X6. The market price of the
loan notes at 1 January 20X3 was $95. Ignoring any question of personal taxation, what do you
estimate to be the current cost of debt?

(b)

If the pre-tax cost of debt rises to 12%, what effect will this have on the market price?

(c)

If the effective rate of tax on company profits is 30%, what would be the after-tax cost of debt of
the loan notes in (a) above? Tax is paid each 31 December on profits earned in that year.

Solution
(a)

292

The current cost of debt is found by calculating the pre-tax internal rate of return of the cash flows
shown in the table below. A discount rate of 10% is chosen for a trial and error start to the
calculation.

Make sure that you know the difference in methods for calculating the cost of irredeemable and
redeemable debt, as this is often a weakness in exams.

4.9 Cost of floating rate debt
If a firm has variable or 'floating rate' debt, then the cost of an equivalent fixed interest debt should be
substituted. 'Equivalent' usually means fixed interest debt with a similar term to maturity in a firm of
similar standing, although if the cost of capital is to be used for project appraisal purposes, there is an
argument for using debt of the same duration as the project under consideration.
The short-term funds such as bank loans and overdrafts is the current interest being charged on such
funds. Alternatively, the cost of debt of ordinary or straight bonds could be used.

4.10 Cost of convertible debt
The cost of capital of convertible to debt is harder to determine. The calculation will depend on whether or
not conversion is likely to happen. Debt holders will only convert if the value of the shares is greater than
the redemption value of the debt.

Formula to
learn

(a)

If conversion is not expected, the conversion value is ignored and the loan note is treated as
redeemable debt, using the IRR method described in Section 4.6.

(b)

If conversion is expected, the IRR method for calculating the cost of redeemable debt is used, but
the number of years to redemption is replaced by the number of years to conversion and the
redemption value is replaced by the conversion value, ie the market value of the shares into which
the debt is to be converted.

Conversion value = P0 (1 + g)nR

Where

P0
g
n
R

is the current ex-dividend ordinary share price
is the expected annual growth of the ordinary share price
is the number of years to conversion
is the number of shares received on conversion

4.11 Example: Cost of convertible debt
A company has issued 8% convertible loan notes which are due to be redeemed in five years' time. They
are currently quoted at $82 per $100 nominal. The loan notes can be converted into 25 shares in five
years' time. The share price is currently $3.50 and is expected to grow at a rate of 3% p.a. Assume a 30%
rate of tax.

When calculating the weighted average cost of capital (see Section 5), the cost of preference shares is a
separate component and should not be combined with the cost of debt or the cost of equity.

4.13 Cost of a bank loan
Finally, the simplest way of calculating the cost of debt is to adjust the pre-tax cost of a bank loan by
multiplying by (1 – tax rate) to create the post-tax cost of the bank loan. This has already been mentioned
in section 1 of chapter 11.

5 Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
12/14, 6/15, Sep/Dec 15, Mar/Jun 16, 12/16, Sep/Dec 17
FAST FORWARD

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the average cost of capital for all the company's
long-term sources of finance, weighted to allow for the relative proportions of each type of capital in the
overall capital structure.
The WACC is calculated by weighting the costs of the individual sources of finance according to their
relative importance as sources of finance.
The WACC represents the return that the company should make on its investments to be able to provide
the returns required by its finance providers.

5.1 Computing a discount rate
We have looked at the costs of individual sources of capital for a company. But how does this help us to
work out the cost of capital as a whole, or the discount rate to apply in DCF investment appraisals?
In many cases it will be difficult to associate a particular project with a particular form of finance. A
company's funds may be viewed as a pool of resources. Money is withdrawn from this pool of funds to
invest in new projects and added to the pool as new finance is raised or profits are retained. Under these
circumstances it might seem appropriate to use an average cost of capital as the discount rate.
The correct cost of capital to use in investment appraisal is the marginal cost of the funds raised (or
earnings retained) to finance the investment. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) might be
considered the most reliable guide to the marginal cost of capital, but only on the assumption that the
company continues to invest in the future, in projects of a standard level of business risk, by raising funds
in the same proportions as its existing capital structure.

5.4 Weighting
Two methods of weighting could be used.

Book
values

Market
values

Market values should always be used if data is available. Although book values are often easier to
obtain, they are based on historical costs and their use will seriously understate the impact of the cost of
equity finance on the average cost of capital. If the WACC is underestimated, unprofitable projects will be
accepted.

5.5 Use of the WACC

Sep/Dec 17

A business's current weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the return required by its investors.
It is logical to apply this WACC to evaluate investments that the business is making. This will be
appropriate if:
(a)

The investment exposes the investors to the same level of business risk that they currently face

(b)

The finance for the investment does not alter the financial risk that the business currently faces (ie
does not change its gearing)

Where an investment does not comply with this then it represents a change in risk and so investors will
expect a different return and the cost of capital will change. This theme is explored in Chapter 16, but here
we note that in these circumstances a business should not use its existing WACC to evaluate an
investment.
It can also be argued that the current weighted average cost of capital should not be used to evaluate
projects that are large in relation to current activities, since such an investment will significantly increase
the risk being faced by shareholders.
Where gearing levels fluctuate significantly, or the finance for a new project carries a significantly different
level of business risk to that of the existing company, or where the project is large, there is good reason to
seek an alternative marginal cost of capital.
The marginal cost of capital approach involves calculating a marginal cut-off rate for acceptable
investment projects by:
(a)

Establishing rates of return for each component of capital structure, except retained earnings,
based on its value if it were to be raised under current market conditions.

(b)

Relating dividends or interest to these values to obtain a marginal cost for each component.

(c)

Applying the marginal cost to each component depending on its proportionate weight within the
capital structure and adding the resultant costs to give a weighted average.

Chapter Roundup


The cost of capital is the rate of return that the enterprise must pay to satisfy the providers of funds, and
it reflects the riskiness of providing funds.



The dividend growth model can be used to estimate a cost of equity, on the assumption that the market
value of share is directly related to the expected future dividends from the shares.



The capital asset pricing model can be used to calculate a cost of equity and incorporates risk.



The CAPM is based on a comparison of the systematic risk of individual investments with the risks of all
shares in the market.



The total risk involved in holding securities (shares) divides into risk specific to the company
(unsystematic) and risk due to variations in market activity (systematic).



Unsystematic risk can be diversified away, while systematic or market risk cannot. Investors may mix a
diversified market portfolio with risk-free assets to achieve a preferred mix of risk and return.



The systematic risk in individual company shares can be measured statistically, by analysing historical
returns.



The CAPM model uses a beta factor to measure a share's volatility in terms of systematic risk.



In accordance with portfolio theory, unsystematic risk is ignored in the CAPM, as it is assumed that
unsystematic risk can be diversified away.



Problems of CAPM include unrealistic assumptions and the required estimates being difficult to make.



The cost of debt is the return an enterprise must pay to its lenders.
–

For irredeemable debt, this is the (post-tax) interest as a percentage of the ex interest market
value of the loan notes (or preferred shares).

–

For redeemable debt, the cost is given by the internal rate of return of the cash flows involved
(interest and capital gain or loss at redemption).

Interest is tax deductible and this is taken into account in the calculations.


The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the average cost of capital for all the company's longterm sources of finance, weighted to allow for the relative proportions of each type of capital in the overall
capital structure.



The WACC is calculated by weighting the costs of the individual sources of finance according to their
relative importance as sources of finance.



The WACC represents the return that the company should make on its investments to be able to provide
the returns required by its finance providers.

Introduction
In Chapter 12, we described different methods by which a company can obtain
long-term finance, in the form of both equity and debt.
This chapter looks now at the effect of sources of finance on the financial
position and financial risk of a company. A central question here is: What are
the implications of using different proportions of equity and debt finance?
The answer to this has to take account of the attitudes of investors to the
financial risk associated with increasing levels of debt finance, and the tradeoff between risk and return.
We also look at various gearing ratios which give us a measure of the extent to
which a company is financed by debt.
In this chapter we shall also be looking at how small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) obtain finance. The sources of finance are important but
this chapter also discusses why SMEs have difficulty raising finance and how
they can tackle the obstacles that exist in obtaining finance.

1 Gearing
Key term

Gearing is the amount of debt finance a company uses relative to its equity finance.

1.1 Financial risk
FAST FORWARD

304

Debt finance tends to be relatively low risk for the debt holder, as it is interest bearing and can be secured.
The cost of debt to the company is therefore relatively low.

15: Gearing and capital structure

Part E Business
finance
w


The greater the level of debt, the more financial risk (of reduced dividends after the payment of debt
interest) to the shareholder of the company, so the higher their required return. The cost of equity
therefore increases with higher gearing.
The assets of a business must be financed somehow and, when a business is growing, the additional
assets must be financed by additional capital.
However, a high level of debt creates financial risk. Financial risk can be seen from different points of
view.
(a)

Ordinary shareholders
Higher levels of financial gearing increase the variability of after-tax profits and earnings per share.
With a high-geared company, a small percentage change in operating profits can result in a much
greater change in after-tax profits and EPS. Greater variability in returns to equity shareholders
means greater financial risk.

(b)

The company as a whole
If a company builds up debts that it cannot pay when they fall due, it will be forced into liquidation.

(c)

Suppliers/lenders
If a company cannot pay its debts, the company will go into liquidation owing suppliers money that
they are unlikely to recover in full. Lenders will therefore want a higher interest yield to
compensate them for higher financial risk and gearing.

1.2 Gearing ratios
FAST FORWARD

Sep/Dec 15, Mar/Jun 16

The financial risk of a company's capital structure can be measured by a gearing ratio, a debt ratio or
debt/equity ratio, or by the interest cover.
Financial gearing measures the relationship between shareholders' funds (equity) and prior charge capital.
It indicates the degree to which the organisation's activities are funded by borrowed funds, as opposed to
shareholder funds.
Operational gearing measures the relationship between contribution and profit before interest and tax. It
indicates the degree to which an organisation's profits are made up of variable (as opposed to fixed) costs.

Exam focus
point

You need to be able to explain and calculate the level of financial gearing using alternative measures.
Financial gearing measures the degree to which an organisation's activities are funded by borrowed
funds, as opposed to shareholder's funds.
Commonly used measures of financial gearing are based on the statement of financial position values of
the fixed interest and equity capital. They include:

Total capital employed*
* Either including or excluding non-controlling (minority) interests, deferred tax and deferred income

Financial gearing =

Prior charge capital is capital which has a right to the receipt of interest or of preferred dividends in
precedence to any claim on distributable earnings on the part of the ordinary shareholders. On winding up,
the claims of holders of prior charge also rank before those of ordinary shareholders.

With the first definition above, a company is low geared if the gearing ratio is less than 100% (meaning it
is funded less by prior charge capital than by equity capital), highly geared if the ratio is over 100% and
neutrally geared if it is exactly 100%. With the second definition, a company is neutrally geared if the ratio
is 50%, low geared below that, and highly geared above that.

1.2.1 Gearing ratios based on market values
An alternative method of calculating a gearing ratio is one based on market values.

Formula to
learn

Financial gearing =

Market value of prior charge capital
Market value of equity Market value of prior charge capital

The advantage of this method is that potential investors in a company are able to judge the further debt
capacity of the company more clearly by reference to market values than they could by looking at
statement of financial position values.
The disadvantage of a gearing ratio based on market values is that it disregards the value of the
company's assets, which might be used to secure further loans. A gearing ratio based on statement of
financial position values arguably gives a better indication of the security for lenders of fixed interest
capital.

1.2.2 Changing financial gearing
Financial gearing is an attempt to quantify the degree of risk involved in holding equity shares in a
company, both in terms of the company's ability to remain in business and in terms of expected ordinary
dividends from the company.
The more geared the company is, the greater the risk that little (if anything) will be available to distribute
by way of dividend to the ordinary shareholders. Interest and preference dividends on debt must continue
to be paid regardless of the company's profits. A high financial gearing therefore means the company is
more vulnerable to poor trading conditions.
There is therefore greater volatility of amount of earnings available for ordinary shareholders, and greater
volatility in dividends paid to those shareholders where a company is highly geared. That is the main
financial risk with high gearing. You may do extremely well or extremely badly, without a particularly large
movement in the profit from operations of the company.
Gearing ultimately measures the company's ability to remain in business. A high-geared company has a
large amount of interest to pay annually. If those borrowings are 'secured' in any way, then the holders of
the debt are perfectly entitled to force the company to realise assets to pay their interest if funds are not
available from other sources. Clearly, the more highly geared a company, the more likely this is to occur if
and when profits fall.

1.2.3 Example: Gearing
Suppose that two companies are identical in every respect except for their gearing. Both have assets of
$20,000 and make the same operating profits (profit before interest and tax: PBIT). The only difference
between the two companies is that Nonlever is all-equity financed and Lever is partly financed by debt
capital, as follows.

Assets
10% loan notes
Ordinary shares of $1

Nonlever
$
20,000
0
20,000
20,000

Lever
$
20,000
(10,000)
10,000
10,000

Because Lever has $10,000 of 10% loan notes it must make a profit before interest of at least $1,000 in
order to pay the interest charges. Nonlever, on the other hand, does not have any minimum PBIT
requirement because it has no debt capital. A company which is lower geared is considered less risky than
a higher geared company because of the greater likelihood that its PBIT will be high enough to cover
interest charges and make a profit for equity shareholders.

1.2.4 Operational gearing

12/16

Financial risk, as we have seen, can be measured by financial gearing. Business risk refers to the risk of
making only low profits, or even losses, due to the nature of the business that the company is involved in.
One way of measuring business risk is by calculating a company's operational gearing.

Formula to
learn

Operational gearing =

Contribution
Profit before interest and tax (PBIT)

Contribution is sales minus variable cost of sales.
Operational gearing indicates the degree to which an organisation's profits are made up of variable (as
opposed to fixed) costs.
The significance of operational gearing is as follows.
(a)

If contribution is high but PBIT is low, the company has a high proportion of fixed costs, which
are only just covered by contribution. Business risk, as measured by operational gearing, will be
high.

(b)

If contribution is not much bigger than PBIT, the company has a low proportion of fixed costs,
which are fairly easily covered by contribution. Business risk, as measured by operational gearing,
will be low.

Operational gearing, like financial gearing, affects the volatility of earnings. If a company has high
operational gearing, a small percentage change in sales revenue will have a much greater percentage
change in operating profits. The proportional size of the change is higher than for a company with low
operational gearing.
A company with both high operational gearing and high financial gearing is likely to have highly volatile
earnings and earnings per share.

1.3 Interest coverage ratio
The interest cover ratio is a measure of financial risk which is designed to show the risks in terms of
profit rather than in terms of capital values.

Formula to
learn

Interest coverage ratio =

Profit before interest and tax
Interest

The reciprocal of this, the interest to profit ratio, is also sometimes used. As a general guide, an interest
coverage ratio of less than three times is considered low, indicating that profitability is too low given the
gearing of the company. An interest coverage ratio of more than seven is usually seen as safe.

1.4 The debt ratio
Another measure of financial risk is the debt ratio.
Debt ratio =

Total debts : Total assets

Debt does not include long-term provisions and liabilities such as deferred taxation.
There is no firm rule on the maximum safe debt ratio but, as a general guide, you might regard 50% as a
safe limit to debt.

Exam focus
point

A change in sources of finance could be examined by the preparation of a cash flow forecast which we
covered in Chapter 6.

1.5 Company circumstances
One determinant of the suitability of the gearing mix is the stability of the company. It may seem obvious,
but it is worth stressing that debt financing will be more appropriate when:


The company is in a healthy competitive position.



Cash flows and earnings are stable.



Profit margins are reasonable.



Operational gearing is low (ie the fixed costs that have to be covered by profits from trading
activities are low).



The bulk of the company's assets are tangible.



The liquidity and cash flow position is strong.



The debt-equity ratio is low.



Share prices are low.

1.6 Cost and flexibility
The cost of debt is likely to be lower than the cost of equity, because debt is less risky from the
debtholders' viewpoint. As we have seen, interest has to be paid no matter what the level of profits, and
debt capital can be secured by fixed and floating charges.
Interest rates on longer-term debt may be higher than interest rates on shorter-term debt, because many
lenders believe longer-term lending to be riskier. However, issue costs or arrangement fees will be higher
for shorter-term debt, as it has to be renewed more frequently.

A business may also find itself locked into longer-term debt, with adverse interest rates and large
penalties if it repays the debt early. Both inflation and uncertainty about future interest rate changes are
reasons why companies are unwilling to borrow long term at high rates of interest and investors are
unwilling to lend long term when they think that interest yields might go even higher.

1.7 Optimal capital structure
When we consider the capital structure decision, the question arises of whether there is an optimal mix of
capital and debt which a company should try to achieve. We will consider this issue in detail in Chapter 16
of this Study Text.

2 Effect on shareholder wealth
FAST FORWARD

If a company can generate returns on capital in excess of the interest payable on debt, financial gearing
will raise the EPS. Gearing will, however, also increase the variability of returns for shareholders and
increase the chance of corporate failure.
A company will only be able to raise finance if investors think the returns they can expect are satisfactory
in view of the risks they are taking.

2.1 Earnings per share
Remember the definition of earnings per share.

Key term

Basic earnings per share should be calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to
ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.

One measure of gearing uses earnings per share.
Financial gearing at a given level of sales =

% change in earnings per share
% change in profits before int erest and tax

The relationship between these two figures can be used to evaluate alternative financing plans by
examining their effect on earnings per share over a range of PBIT levels. Its objective is to determine the
PBIT indifference points among the various alternative financing plans. The indifference points between
any two methods of financing can be determined by solving for PBIT the following equation.
(PBIT – I) (1– t) (PBIT – I) (1– t)
=
S1
S2

Where t = tax rate, I = interest payable, S1 and S2 = number of shares after financing for plans 1 and 2

2.2 Example: PBIT and EPS
Edted Company has 10,000m €1 shares in issue and wants to raise €5,000m to fund an investment by either:
(a)
(b)

Selling 2,500m shares at €2 each, or
Issuing €5,000m 10% loan stock at par.

The income tax rate is 40%.
In order to calculate the indifference point between issuing equity shares and issuing debt, we use the
above equation.
(PBIT – 0) (1– 0.4)
12, 500
10,000

0.6

=

(PBIT – 500) (1– 0.4)
10, 000

PBIT = 12,500

0.6

(PBIT – 500)

6,000 PBIT = 7,500 PBIT – 3,750,000
1,500 PBIT = 3,750,000
PBIT = 2,500
We can prove this calculation as follows.
Issues equity

2,500

PBIT
Interest
PBT

Issues debt
€m
2,500
(500)
2,000
(800)
1,200
10,000
€0.12

At a level of PBIT above €2,500m, it will be better to issue debt, as every € extra of earnings will be
distributed between fewer shareholders. At a level of PBIT below €2,500m, it will be better to issue equity,
as the loss of each € will be shared by more shareholders.
The company's attitude will depend on what levels of earnings it expects and also the variability of
possible earnings limits. Variations from what is expected will have a greater impact on earnings per
share if the company chooses debt finance.

2.3 Price-earnings ratio
You will remember that the price-earnings ratio is calculated in the following way.

Key term

Price-earnings (P/E) ratio =

Market price per share
Earnings per share

You will also recall that the value of the P/E ratio reflects the market's appraisal of the share's future
prospects. If earnings per share falls because of an increased burden arising from increased gearing, an
increased P/E ratio will mean that the share price has not fallen as much as earnings, indicating the market
views positively the projects that the increased gearing will fund.

2.4 Dividend cover
You will recall that the dividend cover is the number of times the actual dividend could be paid out of
current profits.

Formula
Key
termto
learn

Dividend cover =

Earnings per share
Dividend per share

To judge the effect of increased gearing on dividend cover, you should consider changes in the dividend
levels and changes in dividend cover. If earnings decrease because of an increased burden of interest
payments, then:
(a)

The directors may decide to make corresponding reductions in dividend to maintain levels of
dividend cover.

(b)

Alternatively the directions may choose to maintain dividend levels, in which case dividend cover
will fall. This will indicate to shareholders an increased risk that the company will not be able to
maintain the same dividend payments in future years, should earnings fall.

2.5 Dividend yield
Remember that the dividend yield is calculated as follows.

Formula to
learn

Dividend yield =

Dividend per share
Market price per share

100%

We have discussed how increased gearing might affect dividends and dividend cover. However, with
dividend yield, we are also looking at the effect on the market price of shares. If the additional debt finance
is expected to be used to generate good returns in the long term, it is possible that the dividend yield might
fall significantly in the short term because of a fall in short-term dividends, but also an increase in the market
price reflecting market expectations of enhanced long-term returns. How shareholders view this movement
will depend on their preference between short-term and long-term returns.

The company is now considering an investment of $25m. This will add $5m each year to profits before
interest and tax.
(a)

There are two ways of financing this investment. One would be to borrow $25m at a cost of
8% per annum in interest. The other would be to raise the money by means of a one for four rights
issue.

(b)

Whichever financing method is used, the company will increase dividends per share next year from
32.5c to 35c.

(c)

The company does not intend to allow its gearing level, measured as debt finance as a proportion
of equity capital plus debt finance, to exceed 55% as at the end of any financial year. In addition,
the company will not accept any dilution in earnings per share.

Assume that the rate of taxation will remain at 30% and that debt interest costs will be $6m plus the
interest cost of any new debt capital.
Required

(a)

Produce a profit forecast for next year, assuming that the new project is undertaken and is financed
(i) by debt capital or (ii) by a rights issue.

(b)

Calculate the earnings per share next year, with each financing method.

(c)

Calculate the effect on gearing as at the end of next year, with each financing method.

(d)

Explain whether either or both methods of funding would be acceptable.

Answer
Current earnings per share are $10.5m/20million shares = 52.5c
If the project is financed by $25m of debt at 8%, interest charges will rise by $2m. If the project is
financed by a one for four rights issue, there will be 25 million shares in issue.

3 Finance for small and medium-sized entities
FAST FORWARD

SMEs are generally:

–

Key term

Unquoted private companies
Owned by a small number of individuals
Not micro businesses

Small and medium-sized entities (SMEs) have the following characteristics.

(a)

Firms are likely to be unquoted private companies.

(b)

The business is owned by a few individuals, typically a family group.

(c)

They are not micro businesses – very small businesses that act as the owners' medium for
self-employment.

The SME sector accounts for between a third and a half of sales and employment in the UK. The sector is
particularly associated with the service sector and niche markets. If market conditions change, small
businesses may be more adaptable.
There is, however, a significant failure rate among small firms. According to a study by the US Small
Business Association, only two-thirds of small business start-ups survive for two years and less than half
make it to four years after commencing trading.

3.1 The problems of financing SMEs
FAST FORWARD

12/16

SMEs may not know about the sources of finance available.
Finance may be difficult to obtain because of the risks faced by SMEs.
SMEs are restricted in their sources of new equity finance. They are private companies, with a limited
number of shareholders. Unless the shareholders are wealthy, there is a limit to the amount of extra
capital they may be able to invest in the company.
SMEs therefore rely heavily on retained profits for new equity finance, but there is a limit to the amount of
equity that can be obtained from this source, especially when profits are low.
It is not easy for SMEs to attract venture capital. They must be able to demonstrate strong opportunities
for profit growth.
So if SMEs are restricted in the amount of new equity they can obtain, they may rely on borrowing to
supplement their finances.
Government policy can have a major influence on the level of funds available for borrowing.
(a)

Tax policy including concessions given to businesses to invest (tax-allowable depreciation) and
taxes on distributions (higher taxes on dividends mean less income for investors) can have an
impact.

(b)

Interest rate policy can affect lending to SMEs. High interest rates work in different ways –
borrowing for SMEs becomes more expensive, but the supply of funds is also greater, as higher
rates give greater incentives to investors to save.

SMEs, however, also face competition for funds. Investors have opportunities to invest in all sizes of
organisation, as well as overseas and in government debt.
The main handicap that SMEs face in accessing funds is the problem of uncertainty and risk for lenders.
(a)

Whatever the details provided to potential investors, SMEs have neither the business history nor
the longer track record that larger organisations possess.

(b)

Larger enterprises are subject by law to more public scrutiny: their financial statements have to
contain more detail and be audited, they receive more press coverage, and so on.

(c)

Because of the uncertainties involved, banks use credit scoring systems and control their
exposure to the SME business sector.

SMEs will have to provide extensive information about their business to a bank when they seek loan
finance. They will need to give a business plan, a list of the firm's assets, details of the experience of
directors and managers and show how they intend to provide security for sums advanced.
Prospective lenders, usually banks, will then make a decision based on the information provided. The
terms of the loan (interest rate, term, security, repayment details) will depend on the risk involved, and the
lender will also want to monitor their investment.
A common problem is often that the banks will be unwilling to increase loan funding without an increase
in security given in the form of assets (which the owners may be unwilling or unable to give), or an
increase in equity funding (which may be difficult to obtain).
A further problem for SMEs is the maturity gap. It is particularly difficult for SMEs to obtain medium-term
loans due to a mismatching of the maturity of assets and liabilities. Longer-term loans are easier to obtain
than medium-term loans, as longer loans can be secured with mortgages against property.

Business angel financing
Venture capital (covered in Chapter 12)
Leasing (covered in Chapter 12)
Factoring (covered in Chapter 5)
Government assistance (covered in Chapter 2)
Supply chain finance
Crowdfunding/peer to peer funding

Surveys have suggested that small firms have problems accessing different sources of finance because
managers are insufficiently informed about what is available. However, the increased amount of literature
and government agencies designed to help small businesses have resulted in a reduction in this difficulty.

3.2.1 Owner financing
Finance from the owner(s)' personal resources or those of family connections is generally the initial
source of finance. At this stage, because many assets are intangible, external funding may be difficult to
obtain.

3.2.2 Equity finance
Other than investment by owners or business angels, businesses with few tangible assets will probably
have difficulty obtaining equity finance when they are formed (a problem known as the equity gap).
However, once small firms have become established, they do not necessarily need to seek a market listing
to obtain equity financing; shares can be placed privately. Letting external shareholders invest does not
necessarily mean that the original owners have to cede control, particularly if the shares are held by a
number of small investors. However, small companies may find it difficult to obtain large sums by this
means.
As noted above, owners will need to invest a certain amount of capital when the business starts up.
However, owners can subsequently choose whether they withdraw profits from the business or reinvest
them.
Surveys have suggested that the amount of equity invested by owners in a business after start-up and
retained earnings are relatively low compared with other sources of finance. However, the failure of
owners to invest limits the assets that can be acquired, and therefore the amount of security that can be
given for debt capital.
A major problem with obtaining equity finance can be the inability of the small firm to offer an easy exit
route for any investors who wish to sell their stake.
(a)

The firm can purchase its own shares back from the shareholders, but this involves the use of
cash that could be better employed elsewhere.

(b)

The firm can obtain a market listing but not all small firms do.

(c)

The 'exit route' for equity investors in small businesses is often a sale of the business to a larger
company.

Part E Business finance
w

15: Gearing and capital structure

317

3.2.3 Business angel financing
Business angel financing can be an important initial source of business finance. Business angels are
wealthy individuals or groups of individuals who invest directly in small businesses. They are prepared to
take high risks in the hope of high returns.
The main problem with business angel financing is that it is informal in terms of a market and can be
difficult to set up. However, informality can be a strength. There may be less need to provide business
angels with detailed information about the company, since business angels generally have prior
knowledge of the industry.
Surveys suggest that business angels are often more patient than providers of other sources of finance.
However, the money available from individual business angels may be limited, and large sums may only
be available from a consortium of business angels.

3.2.4 Supply chain finance (SCF)
In June 2014, ACCA published a report on supply chain finance. In the glossary, ACCA defined supply
chain finance as, 'the use of financial instruments, practices and technologies to optimise the management
of the working capital and liquidity tied up in supply chain processes for collaborating business partners'
(ACCA, 2014).
The most widely used form of SCF is reverse factoring. Rather confusingly, reverse factoring is
sometimes simply referred to as SCF.
Reverse factoring is a method of financing by selling invoices at a small discount (interest rate) in order
to obtain the cash in advance of the invoice due date. This is achieved through an intermediary fund
provider such as a bank, who provides early payment to the supplier in exchange for the discount, and in
turn receives later payment from the buyer. This is a technology-based process which links the buyer, the
seller and the fund provider. The process works as follows.
Supplier sends invoice to buyer

Buyer approves invoice and
uploads the invoice data onto
the SCF platform

Supplier can see approved
invoices on the platform
EITHER

318

OR

Supplier can wait for payment
(60 days, say)

Supplier can sell invoice to a
funding provider on the platform
for advanced cash (five days,say)

Payment received from buyer
when due

Payment received from buyer

15: Gearing and capital structure

Part E Business
finance
w


When the invoice is due, the buyer pays the fund provider. So the buyer has the advantage of taking 60
days, say, to pay and the supplier has the advantage of being paid in five days, say.
SCF relies on efficient automation and real-time visibility of invoice information. Note also that the
funding provider relies on the creditworthiness of the buyer and the buyer is usually a large company with
a good credit rating.
The good credit rating means that low interest rates are charged to the supplier to purchase the invoice.
Therefore a small or medium-sized supplier has access to a lower interest rate than would normally be
available to them.

3.2.5 Crowdfunding/peer to peer funding
SMEs are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain funding in the traditional way, ie from a bank. At the
same time, investors are finding that banks are offering very low returns for their money. This situation
has led to the development of crowdfunding.
Crowdfunding is the funding of a project by raising money from a large number of people. It is usually
carried out via the internet and involves the initiator, the people willing to support the project and a
platform to bring them together. Various platforms are now in existence, such as www.crowdcube.com
and www.seedrs.com.

Case Study
Kickstarter, one of the world's leading crowdfunding websites, has launched in both Hong Kong and
Singapore, its first sites in Asia.

The crowdfunding concept allows people to present innovations or business ideas online to ask for
funding.
Until now, Kickstarter has operated in North America, Australia and Europe.
As a result, entrepreneurs in Singapore or Hong Kong had to co-operate with overseas partners if they
wanted their ideas on the website.
With Kickstarter now launching in Hong Kong and Singapore, people can present their projects from a
local base and with their fundraising goals set in Hong Kong or Singapore dollars.
Kickstarter will have to compete with local crowdfunding platforms such as Singapore's MoolahSense and
OurCrowd or Hong Kong's FringeBacker.
Crowdfunding sites offer a platform to present a project or business idea and ask for financial support.
In order to win financial pledges, the projects needs to spell out the exact financial goal and by when it
aims to reach it.
Kickstarter makes money by taking a cut from the amount the projects receive.
Prominent examples of products started on Kickstarter include the Oculus Rift headset, which received its
first funding via Kickstarter in 2012, and the Pebble smartwatch.
(BBC, 2016)

3.3 Capital structure
Significant influences on the capital structure of small firms are:



The lack of separation between ownership and management
The lack of equity finance

Studies have suggested that the owners' preference and market considerations are also significant. Small
firms tend not to have target debt ratios.

Part E Business finance
w

15: Gearing and capital structure

319

Other studies suggest that the life cycle of the firm is important. Debt finance is an important early
source, its availability depending on the security available.
As firms mature, however, the reliance on debt declines. There seems to be little evidence of a relationship
between gearing, and profitability and risk levels.

3.4 Government aid for SMEs
FAST FORWARD

Exam focus
point

Government aid schemes are country-specific.

Availability of government assistance is country-specific. For the exam, at a minimum, you should be
aware of the possibilities of such assistance and the major schemes operating in at least one country.
Some governments provide assistance schemes to help businesses. Some schemes may be designed to
encourage lenders and investors to make finance available to small and unquoted businesses.

3.4.1 Loan schemes
Some governments may provide loan schemes to facilitate lending to viable businesses that have been
turned down for a normal commercial loan due to a lack of security or a proven track record.

3.4.2 Grants
A grant is a sum of money given to an individual or business for a specific project or purpose. A grant
usually covers only part of the total costs involved.
Grants to help with business development are available from a variety of sources, such as
the government, European Union, Regional Growth Fund, local authorities and some charitable
organisations.
These grants may be linked to business activity or a specific industry sector. Some grants are linked to
specific geographical areas, eg those in need of economic regeneration.

The term of the finance

The term should be appropriate to the asset being acquired. As a general rule, long-term assets
should be financed from long-term finance sources. Cheaper short-term funds should be used to
finance short-term requirements, such as fluctuations in the level of working capital.
Flexibility

Short-term debt is a more flexible source of finance; there may be penalties for repaying long-term
debt early. If the company takes out long-term debt and interest rates fall, it will find itself locked
into unfavourable terms.
Repayment terms

The company must have sufficient funds to be able to meet repayment schedules laid down in
loan agreements, and to cover interest costs. Although there may be no specific terms of
repayment laid down for short-term debt, it may possibly be repayable on demand, so it may be
risky to finance long-term capital investments in this way.
Costs
Interest on short-term debt is usually less than on long-term debt. However, if short-term debt has
to be renewed frequently, issue expenses may raise its cost significantly.
Availability

It may be difficult to renew short-term finance in the future if the company's position or economic
conditions change adversely.
Effect on gearing

Certain types of short-term debt (bank overdrafts, increased credit from suppliers) will not be
included in gearing calculations. If a company is seen as too highly geared, lenders may be
unwilling to lend money, or judge that the high risk of default must be compensated by higher
interest rates or restrictive covenants.
(b)

Previous record of company

If the company (or possibly its directors or even shareholders) has a low credit rating with credit
reference agencies, investors may be unwilling to subscribe for loan notes. Banks may be
influenced by this, and also by their own experiences of the company as customer (has the
company exceeded overdraft limits in the past on a regular basis).
Restrictions in memorandum and articles

The company should examine the legal documents carefully to see if they place any restrictions on
what the company can borrow, and for what purposes.
Restrictions of current borrowing

The terms of any loans to the company that are currently outstanding may contain restrictions
about further borrowing that can be taken out.
Uncertainty over project

The project is a significant one, and presumably the interest and ultimately repayment that
lenders obtain may be very dependent on the success of the project. If the results are uncertain,
lenders may not be willing to take the risk.
Security

The company may be unwilling to provide the security that lenders require, particularly if it is
faced with restrictions on what it can do with the assets secured.
Alternatively, it may have insufficient assets to provide the necessary security.

Chapter Roundup


Debt finance tends to be relatively low risk for the debt holder, as it is interest bearing and can be secured.
The cost of debt to the company is therefore relatively low.



The greater the level of debt, the more financial risk (of reduced dividends after the payment of debt
interest) to the shareholder of the company, so the higher is their required return. The cost of equity
therefore increases with higher gearing.



The financial risk of a company's capital structure can be measured by a gearing ratio, a debt ratio or
debt/equity ratio, or by the interest cover.



Financial gearing measures the relationship between shareholders' funds (equity) and prior charge capital.
It indicates the degree to which the organisation's activities are funded by borrowed funds, as opposed to
shareholder funds.



Operational gearing measures the relationship between contribution and profit before interest and tax. It
indicates the degree to which an organisation's profits are made up of variable (as opposed to fixed) costs.



If a company can generate returns on capital in excess of the interest payable on debt, financial gearing
will raise the EPS. Gearing will, however, also increase the variability of returns for shareholders and
increase the chance of corporate failure.

12/14, 9/16

Some commentators believe that an optimal mix of finance exists at which the company's cost of capital
will be minimised.

You may find it useful to read the article titled 'Optimum capital structure' which is available on the ACCA
website.
A company should seek to minimise its weighted average cost of capital. By doing so, it minimises its cost
of funds. The weighted average cost of capital is an average cost of all the different sources of finance that
a company uses. By changing the proportions of each type of finance, it will alter its WACC.
So how can a company adjust its financing structure in such a way that its WACC is minimised?
There are different views on the answer to this question. One is the so-called 'traditional' view. Another is
a view proposed by Modigliani and Miller.
The traditional view concludes that there is an optimal capital mix of equity and debt at which the
weighted average cost of capital is minimised.
However, the alternative view of Modigliani and Miller (assuming no tax) is that the firm's overall
weighted average cost of capital is not influenced by changes in its capital structure.

326

16: Capital structure

Part E Business financew


Both views agree that:


The cost of equity is higher than the cost of debt.



As the level of gearing increases, the larger proportion of debt in the capital structure means that
there is a larger proportion of lower-cost finance.



However, as the level of gearing rises, the cost of equity also rises to compensate shareholders for
the higher risk.



As gearing increases, the higher proportion of low-cost debt but the rising cost of equity pull the
WACC in opposite directions.

1.1 The traditional view
FAST FORWARD

Under the traditional theory of cost of capital, the weighted average cost of capital declines initially as
gearing increases, but then rises as gearing increases further. The optimal capital structure is at the
gearing level where WACC is lowest.
The traditional view is as follows.
(a)

As the level of gearing increases, the cost of debt remains unchanged up to a certain level of
gearing. Beyond this level, the cost of debt will increase.

(b)

The cost of equity rises as the level of gearing increases and financial risk increases. There is a
non-linear relationship between the cost of equity and gearing.

(c)

The weighted average cost of capital does not remain constant, but rather falls initially as the
proportion of debt capital increases, and then begins to increase as the rising cost of equity (and
possibly of debt) becomes more significant.

(d)

The optimum level of gearing is where the company's weighted average cost of capital is
minimised.

The traditional view about the cost of capital is illustrated in the following figure.

WACC
Cost of
capital

1

2

P

Gearing increasing

At point 1, the cost of capital falls as the level of debt finance increases. This is because debt is cheaper
than equity.
Point P shows the optimum level of debt: cheap debt finance minimises the cost of capital.
At point 2, the cost of capital increases as the level of debt finance continues to increase. This is because
above the optimum level of debt finance, the company is perceived to be high risk by shareholders and
lenders, who start to demand a higher level of return.
The figure below shows the same cycle, illustrating the changes in cost of capital, cost of debt and cost of
equity.

The traditional view does not identify the optimal level of gearing. Another drawback is that it fails to
consider the impact of tax on the cost of debt finance.

1.2 Net operating income view of WACC: Modigliani-Miller (M&M)
FAST FORWARD

Modigliani and Miller stated that, in the absence of tax relief on debt interest, a company's capital
structure would have no impact on its WACC. WACC would be the same regardless of the company's
capital structure.
The net operating income approach takes a different view of the effect of gearing on WACC. In their 1958
theory, Modigliani and Miller (M&M) proposed that the total market value of a company, in the absence of
tax relief on debt interest, will be determined only by two factors:
1
2

The total earnings of the company
The level of operating (business) risk attached to those earnings

The total market value would be computed by discounting the total earnings at a rate that is appropriate to
the level of operating risk. This rate would represent the WACC of the company.
Thus M&M concluded that the capital structure of a company would have no effect on its overall value
or WACC (quoted in: Watson and Head, 2013, p.299).

1.2.1 Assumptions of net operating income approach
M&M made various assumptions in arriving at this conclusion, including:
(a)

A perfect capital market exists, in which investors have the same information, on which they act
rationally, to arrive at the same expectations about future earnings and risks.

(b)

There are no tax or transaction costs.

(c)

Debt is risk free and freely available at the same cost to investors and companies alike.

M&M justified their approach by the use of arbitrage.

Key term

Arbitrage is when a purchase and sale of a security takes place simultaneously in different markets, with
the aim of making a risk-free profit through the exploitation of any price difference between the markets.
Arbitrage can be used to show that once all opportunities for profit have been exploited, the market values of
two companies with the same earnings in equivalent business risk classes will have moved to an equal value.

If M&M's theory holds, it implies:
(a)
(b)

The cost of debt remains unchanged as the level of gearing increases.
The cost of equity rises in such a way as to keep the weighted average cost of capital constant.

1.3 Example: Net operating income approach
A company has $5,000 of debt at 10% interest, and earns $5,000 a year before interest is paid. There are
2,250 issued shares, and the weighted average cost of capital of the company is 20%.
The market value of the company should be as follows.
Earnings

$5,000

Suppose that the level of gearing is increased by issuing $5,000 more of debt at 10% interest to
repurchase 562 shares (at a market value of $8.89 per share) leaving 1,688 shares in issue.
The weighted average cost of capital will, according to the net operating income approach, remain
unchanged at 20%. The market value of the company should still therefore be $25,000.

= 26.667% and the market value per share is still:

1
= $8.89
0.2667

The conclusion of the net operating income approach is that the level of gearing is a matter of indifference
to an investor, because it does not affect the market value of the company, nor of an individual share. This
is because as the level of gearing rises, so does the cost of equity in such a way as to keep both the
weighted average cost of capital and the market value of the shares constant. Although, in our example,
the dividend per share rises from $2 to $2.37, the increase in the cost of equity is such that the market
value per share remains at $8.89.

1.4 M&M theory after tax
In 1963 Modigliani and Miller modified their theory to admit that tax relief on interest payments does
lower the weighted average cost of capital. The savings arising from tax relief on debt interest are the tax
shield.
However, whereas the traditional approach to gearing and WACC is that there is an optimal level of gearing
where WACC is minimised, M&M took a different view. They argued that the weighted average cost of
capital continues to fall, up to gearing of 100% (Watson and Head, 2013, p.301).

ko

Gearing up to 100%

This suggests that companies should have a capital structure made up entirely of debt. This does not
happen in practice due to the existence of market imperfections and other practical issues which
undermine the tax advantages of debt finance.

1.4.1 Market imperfections: bankruptcy costs
MM's theory assumes perfect capital markets so a company would always be able to raise finance and
avoid bankruptcy. In reality, however, at higher levels of gearing there is an increasing risk of the company
being unable to meet its interest payments and being declared bankrupt. At these higher levels of gearing,
the bankruptcy risk means that shareholders will require a higher rate of return as compensation.

1.4.2 Market imperfections: agency costs
At higher levels of gearing there are also agency costs as a result of action taken by concerned debt
holders. Providers of debt finance are likely to impose restrictive covenants, such as restriction of future
dividends or the imposition of minimum levels of liquidity in order to protect their investment. They may
also increase their level of monitoring and require more financial information.

16: Capital structure

Part E Business financew


1.4.3 Tax exhaustion
As companies increase their gearing they may reach a point where there are not enough profits from
which to obtain all available tax benefits. They will still be subject to increased bankruptcy and agency
costs but will not be able to benefit from the increased tax shield.

1.5 Pecking order theory
Pecking order theory is based on what companies do, not what they necessarily should do. This theory is
based on the view that companies will not seek to minimise their WACC. Instead they will seek additional
finance in an order of preference, or 'pecking order'.
Pecking order theory states that firms will prefer retained cash to any other source of finance, and then
will choose debt, and last of all equity. The order of preference will be:






Retained cash
Straight debt (bank loans or loan notes)
Convertible debt
Preference shares
Issue new equity shares

1.5.1 Reasons for following pecking order
(a)

It is easier to use retained cash than go to the trouble of obtaining external finance and have to live
up to the demands of external finance providers.

(b)

There are no issue costs if retained cash is used, and the issue costs of debt are lower than those
of equity.

(c)

Investors prefer safer securities; that is, debt with its guaranteed income and priority on
liquidation.

(d)

Some managers believe that debt issues have a better signalling effect than equity issues because
the market believes that managers are better informed about shares' true worth than the market
itself is. Their view is that the market will interpret debt issues as a sign of confidence, that
businesses are confident of making sufficient profits to fulfil their obligations on debt and that the
shares are undervalued.
By contrast, the market will interpret equity issues as a measure of last resort, that managers
believe that equity is currently overvalued and hence are trying to achieve high proceeds while they
can.
However, an issue of debt may imply a similar lack of confidence to an issue of equity; managers
may issue debt when they believe that the cost of debt is low due to the market underestimating
the risk of default and therefore undervaluing the risk premium in the cost of debt. If the market
recognises this lack of confidence, it is likely to respond by raising the cost of debt.

1.5.2 Consequences of pecking order theory
(a)

Businesses will try to match investment opportunities with internal finance provided this does not
mean excessive changes in dividend payout ratios.

(b)

If it is not possible to match investment opportunities with internal finance, surplus internal
funds will be invested; if there is a deficiency of internal funds, external finance will be issued in the
pecking order, starting with straight debt.

(c)

Establishing an ideal debt-equity mix will be problematic, since internal equity funds will be the
first source of finance that businesses choose, and external equity funds the last.

w Part E

Business finance

16: Capital structure

331

1.5.3 Limitations of pecking order theory
(a)

It fails to take into account taxation, financial distress, agency costs or how the investment
opportunities that are available may influence the choice of finance.

(b)

Pecking order theory is an explanation of what businesses actually do, rather than what they
should do.

Studies suggest that the businesses that are most likely to follow pecking order theory are those that are
operating profitably in markets where growth prospects are poor. There will thus be limited opportunities
to invest funds, and these businesses will be content to rely on retained cash for the limited resources that
they need.

2 Impact of cost of capital on investments
FAST FORWARD

The lower a company's WACC, the higher the NPV of its future cash flows and the higher its market value.

2.1 The relationship between company value and cost of capital
The market value of a company depends on its cost of capital. The lower a company's WACC, the higher
the net present value of its future cash flows will be and therefore the higher its market value. We will
consider business valuations in more detail in Part G of this Study Text.

2.2 Using the WACC in investment appraisal
The weighted average cost of capital can be used in investment appraisal if:
(a)
(b)
(c)

The project being appraised is small relative to the company.
The existing capital structure will be maintained (same financial risk).
The project has the same business risk as the company.

2.3 Arguments against using the WACC
(a)

New investments undertaken by a company might have different business risk characteristics from
the company's existing operations. As a consequence, the return required by investors might go up
(or down) if the investments are undertaken, because their business risk is perceived to be higher
(or lower).

(b)

The finance that is raised to fund a new investment might substantially change the capital structure
and the perceived financial risk of investing in the company. Depending on whether the project is
financed by equity or by debt capital, the perceived financial risk of the entire company might
change. This must be taken into account when appraising investments.

(c)

Many companies raise floating-rate debt capital as well as fixed interest debt capital. With
floating-rate debt capital, the interest rate is variable, and is altered every three or six months or so
in line with changes in current market interest rates. The cost of debt capital will therefore fluctuate
as market conditions vary. Floating-rate debt is difficult to incorporate into a WACC computation,
and the best that can be done is to substitute an 'equivalent' fixed interest debt capital cost in place
of the floating-rate debt cost.

2.4 Using CAPM in investment appraisal

12/14, 9/16

We looked at how the CAPM can be used to calculate a cost of equity incorporating risk in Chapter 14. It
can also be used to calculate a project-specific cost of capital.
The CAPM produces a required return based on the expected return of the market E(rm), the risk-free
interest rate (Rf) and the variability of project returns relative to the market returns ( ). Its main advantage
when used for investment appraisal is that it produces a discount rate which is based on the systematic
risk of the individual investment.

332

16: Capital structure

Part E Business financew


It can be used to compare projects of all different risk classes and is therefore superior to an NPV
approach which uses only one discount rate for all projects, regardless of their risk.
The model was developed with respect to securities; by applying it to an investment within the firm, the
company is assuming that the shareholder wishes investments to be evaluated as if they were securities in
the capital market and thus assumes that all shareholders will hold diversified portfolios and will not look
to the company to achieve diversification for them.

2.5 Example: Required return
Panda is all-equity financed. It wishes to invest in a project with an estimated beta of 1.5. The project has
significantly different business risk characteristics from Panda's current operations. The project requires
an outlay of $10,000 and will generate expected returns of $12,000.
The market rate of return is 12% and the risk-free rate of return is 6%.
Required

Estimate the minimum return that Panda will require from the project and assess whether the project is
worthwhile, based on the figures you are given.

Solution
We do not need to know Panda's current weighted average cost of capital, as the new project has different
business characteristics from its current operations. Instead we use the capital asset pricing model so
that:
Required return = Rf +

(E (rm) – Rf)

= 6 + 1.5(12 – 6)
= 15%
12,000 10,000
10,000
= 20%

Expected return =

Thus the project is worthwhile, as expected return exceeds required return.

2.6 Limitations of using CAPM in investment decisions
The greatest practical problems with the use of the CAPM in capital investment decisions are as follows.
(a)

It is hard to estimate returns on projects under different economic environments, market returns
under different economic environments and the probabilities of the various environments.

(b)

The CAPM is really just a single period model. Few investment projects last for one year only and
to extend the use of the return estimated from the model to more than one time period would
require both project performance relative to the market and the economic environment to be
reasonably stable.
In theory, it should be possible to apply the CAPM for each time period, thus arriving at successive
discount rates, one for each year of the project's life. In practice, this would exacerbate the
estimation problems mentioned above and also make the discounting process much more
cumbersome.

(c)

It may be hard to determine the risk-free rate of return. Government securities are usually taken
to be risk free, but the return on these securities varies according to their term to maturity.

(d)

Some experts have argued that betas calculated using complicated statistical techniques often
overestimate high betas and underestimate low betas, particularly for small companies.

2.7 CAPM and MM combined – geared betas
FAST FORWARD

When an investment has differing business and finance risks from the existing business, geared betas
may be used to obtain an appropriate cost of capital and required rate of return for an investment.
Geared betas are calculated by:



Ungearing industry betas
Converting ungeared betas back into a geared beta that reflects the company's own gearing ratio

2.7.1 Beta values and the effect of gearing
The gearing of a company will affect the risk of its equity. If a company is geared and its financial risk is
therefore higher than the risk of an all-equity company, then the value of the geared company's equity
will be higher than the value of a similar ungeared company's equity.
The earnings of a company with gearing are more volatile than the earnings of an all-equity company. This
means that the beta factor (a measure of its systematic risk) is larger for a geared company than an
ungeared company. Similarly, the beta factor of a high-geared company is greater than the beta factor of a
low-geared company, because the volatility in its earnings is greater.
The CAPM is consistent with the propositions of Modigliani and Miller. MM argue that as gearing rises, the
cost of equity rises to compensate shareholders for the extra financial risk of investing in a geared
company. This financial risk is an aspect of systematic risk, and ought to be reflected in a company's beta
factor.

2.7.2 Geared betas and ungeared betas
The connection between MM theory and the CAPM means that it is possible to establish a mathematical
relationship between the value of an ungeared company and the value of a similar, but geared,
company. The value of a geared company will be higher than the value of a company identical in every
respect except that it is all-equity financed. This is because of the extra financial risk. The mathematical
relationship between the 'ungeared' (or asset) and 'geared' betas is as follows.

2.7.4 Using the geared and ungeared (asset) beta formula to estimate a beta factor
So what is the relevance of geared and ungeared (asset) betas?
A private company may want to evaluate a proposed new investment using DCF and so wants to identify a
suitable cost of capital to use as the discount rate. Because it is a private company, it does not have a beta
factor. However, it may identify a listed company that is similar to itself in many ways, and whose beta
factor it can use to establish its own cost of equity. If the listed company and the private company are
similar in every respect except for their gearing, it would be appropriate to adjust the estimated beta factor
for the private company by making an adjustment for the difference in gearing levels between the two
companies.
If a company plans to invest in a project which involves diversification into a new business, the investment
will involve a different level of systematic risk from that applying to the company's existing business. A
discount rate should be calculated which is specific to the project, and which takes account of both the
project's systematic risk and the company's gearing level. The discount rate can be found using the
CAPM.

Get an estimate of the systematic risk characteristics of the project's operating cash flows
by obtaining published beta values for companies in the industry into which the company is
planning to diversify.

Step 2

Adjust these beta values to allow for the company's capital gearing level. This adjustment is
done in two stages.

If an exam question provides a number of ungeared (asset) betas for other companies in the new business
sector, you may need to calculate an average ungeared (asset) beta for the industry by adding up the betas
and then dividing by the number of betas being averaged. For example if three betas are provided, the
average would be the addition of the three betas divided by three.

Having obtained an ungeared beta value a, convert it back to a geared beta
which reflects the company's own gearing ratio, using the formula:

Having estimated a project-specific geared beta, use the CAPM to estimate a project-specific
cost of equity. Having calculated a cost of equity, it may be necessary in reality to calculate
a weighted average cost of capital if there is also debt capital in the financing but
calculating an adjusted WACC will not be tested numerically in the real exam.

An example will be used to illustrate the method.

2.7.5 Gearing and ungearing betas
A company's debt:equity ratio, by market values, is 2:5. The corporate debt, which is assumed to be risk
free, yields 11% before tax. The beta value of the company's equity is currently 1.1. The average returns
on stock market equity are 16%.
The company is now proposing to invest in a project which would involve diversification into a new
industry, and the following information is available about this industry.
(a)
(b)

Average beta coefficient of equity capital = 1.59
Average debt:equity ratio in the industry = 1:2 (by market value)

The rate of corporation tax is 30%. What would be a suitable cost of capital to apply to the project?

Solution
The company should not use its existing WACC as the discount rate for the planned project, because the
investment will be in a different industry or market sector where the systematic risk is different.
Instead it can use the average systematic risk in the 'new' industry to determine a cost of capital. A
problem is that the beta factor for listed companies that are already in the industry is different to some
extent because of the different gearing level.
To get round this problem, we calculate a geared beta for the company based on the average geared betas
of companies already in the industry, adjusted to allow for the difference in gearing.
This is essentially a three-step process.

336

(1)

Convert the geared beta for the new industry into an ungeared beta.

(2)

Use the ungeared beta to calculate a geared beta that reflects the company's own capital structure.

Part E Business financew


(3)

Use this geared beta to calculate an appropriate cost of equity for the investment. This cost of
equity should be used to determine an appropriate weighted cost of capital to use as the discount
rate.

The beta value for the industry is 1.59.

Step 1

Convert the geared beta value for the industry to an ungeared beta (asset beta) for the
industry.
a

Step 2

own gearing level of 2:5.
e

Step 3

(a)

= 1.18

5 (2 (1 0.30))
5

= 1.51

This is a project-specific beta for the firm's equity capital and so, using the CAPM,
we can estimate the project-specific cost of equity as:
keg = 11% + (16% – 11%) 1.51 = 18.55%

(b)

The project will presumably be financed in a gearing ratio of 2:5 debt to equity, and
so the project-specific cost of capital ought to be:
[5/7

18.55%] + [2/7

70%

11%] = 15.45%

Question

Two companies are identical in every respect except for their capital structure. XY has a debt:equity ratio

2.7.6 Weaknesses in the formula
The problems with using the geared and ungeared beta formula for calculating a firm's equity beta from
data about other firms are as follows.
(a)

It is difficult to identify other firms with identical operating characteristics.

(b)

Estimates of beta values from share price information are not wholly accurate. They are based
on statistical analysis of historical data and, as the previous example shows, estimates using one
firm's data will differ from estimates using another firm's data.

(c)

There may be differences in beta values between firms caused by:
(i)
Different cost structures (eg the ratio of fixed costs to variable costs)
(ii)
Size differences between firms
(iii)
Debt capital not being risk free

w Part E

Business finance

16: Capital structure

337

(d)

If the firm for which an equity beta is being estimated has opportunities for growth that are
recognised by investors, and which will affect its equity beta, estimates of the equity beta based on
other firms' data will be inaccurate, because the opportunities for growth will not be allowed for.

Perhaps the most significant simplifying assumption is that, to link MM theory to the CAPM, it must be
assumed that the cost of debt is a risk-free rate of return. This could obviously be unrealistic. Companies
may default on interest payments or capital repayments on their loans. It has been estimated that
corporate debt has a beta value of 0.2 or 0.3.
The consequence of making the assumption that debt is risk free is that the formulae tend to overstate the
financial risk in a geared company and to understate the business risk in geared and ungeared companies
by a compensating amount.

Question

Gearing and ungearing betas

Backwoods is a major international company with its head office in the UK, wanting to raise £150m to
establish a new production plant in the eastern region of Germany. Backwoods evaluates its investments
using NPV, but is not sure what cost of capital to use in the discounting process for this project
evaluation.
The company is also proposing to increase its equity finance in the near future for UK expansion, resulting
overall in little change in the company's market-weighted capital gearing.
The summarised financial data for the company before the expansion are shown below.

medium- and long-term loans are floating-rate UK bank loans at LIBOR plus 1%, with an after-tax cost of
debt of 7%.
Company rate of tax may be assumed to be at the rate of 30%. The company's ordinary shares are
currently trading at 376p.
The equity beta of Backwoods is estimated to be 1.18. The systematic risk of debt may be assumed to be
zero. The risk-free rate is 7.75% and market return is 14.5%.
The estimated equity beta of the main German competitor in the same industry as the new proposed plant
in the eastern region of Germany is 1.5, and the competitor's capital gearing is 35% equity and 65% debt
by book values, and 60% equity and 40% debt by market values.

Required

Estimate the cost of capital that the company should use as the discount rate for its proposed investment
in eastern Germany. State clearly any assumptions that you make.

Answer
The discount rate that should be used is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), with weightings
based on market values. The cost of capital should take into account the systematic risk of the new
investment, and therefore it will not be appropriate to use the company's existing equity beta. Instead, the
estimated equity beta of the main German competitor in the same industry as the new proposed plant will
be ungeared, and then the capital structure of Backwoods applied to find the WACC to be used for the
discount rate.
Since the systematic risk of debt can be assumed to be zero, the German equity beta can be 'ungeared'
using the following expression.

Chapter Roundup


Some commentators believe that an optimal mix of finance exists at which the company's cost of capital
will be minimised.



Under the traditional theory of cost of capital, the weighted average cost of capital declines initially as
gearing increases, but then rises as gearing increases further. The optimal capital structure is at the
gearing level where WACC is lowest.



Modigliani and Miller stated that, in the absence of tax relief on debt interest, a company's capital
structure would have no impact on its WACC. WACC would be the same regardless of the company's
capital structure.



The lower a company's WACC, the higher the NPV of its future cash flows and the higher its market value.



When an investment has differing business and finance risks from the existing business, geared betas
may be used to obtain an appropriate cost of capital and required rate of return for an investment.

1 The nature and purpose of business valuations
FAST FORWARD

There are a number of different ways of putting a value on a business, or on shares in an unquoted
company. It makes sense to use several methods of valuation, and to compare the values they produce.

1.1 When valuations are required
Given quoted share prices on a stock exchange, why devise techniques for estimating the value of a
share? A share valuation will be necessary:
(a)

Key term

348

For quoted companies, when there is a takeover bid and the offer price is an estimated 'fair value'
in excess of the current market price of the shares

A takeover is the acquisition by a company of a controlling interest in the voting share capital of another
company, usually achieved by the purchase of a majority of the voting shares.
