1 Exchange rates
1.1 Exchange rates
Key terms

An exchange rate is the rate at which one country's currency can be traded in exchange for another
country's currency.
The spot rate is the exchange rate currently offered on a particular currency for immediate delivery.
A forward rate is an exchange rate set now for currencies to be exchanged at a future date.
Every traded currency in fact has many exchange rates. There is an exchange rate with every other traded
currency on the foreign exchange markets. Foreign exchange dealers make their profit by buying currency
for less than they sell it, and so there are really two exchange rates, a selling rate and a buying rate. Rates
change continually, because there is a huge volume of transactions daily in the foreign exchange (FX)
markets globally.

Exam focus
point

In the exam, and in many of the practice questions, the domestic currency is normally dollars.
The use of dollars as the domestic currency does not necessarily mean that we are dealing with the US
dollar – it is simply being consistent with the fact that cash flows in the ACCA exams are usually expressed
in dollars.

1.2 Foreign exchange demand
If an importer has to pay a foreign supplier in a foreign currency, they might ask their bank to sell them
the required amount of the currency, so that they can make the payment. For example, suppose that a US
bank's customer, a trading company, has imported goods for which it must now pay 10,000 peso.
(a)

The company will ask the bank to sell it 10,000 peso. If the company is buying currency, the bank
is selling it.

(b)

When the bank agrees to sell 10,000 peso to the company, it will tell the company what the spot
rate of exchange will be for the transaction. If the bank's selling rate (known as the 'offer', or 'ask'
price) is, say, 1.5135 peso per $1 for the currency, the bank will charge the company:
10,000/1.5135 = $6,607.20

Similarly, if a US exporter is paid, say, 10,000 peso by a foreign customer, they may wish to exchange the
pesos to obtain dollars. They will therefore ask the bank to buy the pesos from them. Since the exporter is
selling currency to the bank, the bank is buying the currency.
If the bank quotes a buying rate (known as the bid price) of, say, 1.5195 pesos per $1, for the currency
the bank will pay the exporter:
10,000/1.5195 = $6,581.11
A bank expects to make a profit from selling and buying currency, and it does so by offering a rate for
selling a currency which is different from the rate for buying the currency.

(b)

The bank is being asked to sell the yen to the importer and will charge for the currency:
1,000,000/168.650 = $5,929.44

1.3 The foreign exchange (FX) markets
Banks buy currency from customers and sell currency to customers – typically, exporting and importing
firms. Banks may buy currency from a government or sell currency to a government. Banks also buy and
sell currency between themselves.
International trade involves foreign currency, for either the buyer, the seller, or both (for example, a Saudi
Arabian firm might sell goods to a Malaysian buyer and invoice for the goods in US dollars). As a
consequence, it is quite likely that exporters might want to sell foreign currency earnings to a bank in
exchange for domestic currency, and that importers might want to buy foreign currency from a bank in
order to pay a foreign supplier.
Since most foreign exchange rates are not fixed but are allowed to vary, rates are continually changing and
each bank will offer new rates for new customer enquiries according to how its dealers judge the market
situation.

2 Foreign currency risk

9/16

Performance objective 11 requires you to 'advise on using instruments or techniques to manage financial
risk'. This chapter covers the management of foreign currency risk.
FAST FORWARD

Currency risk is the risk of changes in an exchange rate or in the foreign exchange value of a currency. It
is a two-way risk.

Currency risk occurs in three forms: transaction exposure (effect on short-term cash flows), economic
exposure (effect on present value of longer-term cash flows) and translation exposure (gains or losses in
the value of foreign currency assets or liabilities).

2.1 The nature of foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk, also called currency risk or FX risk, is the risk arising from unforeseen changes in
an exchange rate or the value of a currency.
Business decisions may be made now, but the profits or returns from those decisions may depend on
exchange rates in the future.

384

19: Foreign currency risk

Part G Risk management
w


Foreign currency risk is a two-way risk. This means that exchange rate movements may be favourable as
well as adverse, so the term 'risk' can be misleading.

For example, say a UK company buys goods from a US supplier costing $336,000, for settlement in three
months' time. If the current spot rate of exchange is $1.50 = $1, the expected cost of the goods for the UK
buyer will be £224,000 (= $336,000/$1.50).
If the UK company does nothing to protect itself against the risk of exchange rate movement, it may do
nothing for three months, and then buy the $336,000 at whatever the spot rate is at that time. If the spot
rate after three months is $1.40 = £1, the cost of the goods will be £240,000, which is £16,000 more than
expected. However, if the spot exchange rate is $1.60, the cost of the goods will be £210,000, which is
£14,000 less than expected.
The UK company should consider the seriousness of the risk, and the potential consequences of an
adverse movement in the exchange rate. The seriousness of the risk will depend to some extent on
expectations of future movements in the dollar-sterling spot exchange rate.

2.2 Translation risk
Translation risk is the risk that the organisation will make exchange losses when the accounting results of
its foreign branches or subsidiaries are translated into the home currency. Translation losses can result,
for example, from re-stating the book value of a foreign subsidiary's assets at the exchange rate on the
statement of financial position date.
The effect of translation risk is to create gains or losses in the reported financial results of the parent
group, but they do not create cash flow gains or losses.

2.3 Transaction risk
Transaction risk is the risk of adverse exchange rate movements occurring in the course of normal
international trading transactions. This arises when the prices of imports or exports are fixed in foreign
currency terms and there is movement in the exchange rate between the date when the price is agreed and
the date when the cash is paid or received in settlement.
For example, if an Australian company buys goods from a US supplier for an agreed price of
US$1,000,000, with payment in two months' time, it is exposed to a transaction risk, that the US dollar
may strengthen in value against the Australian dollar during the two-month credit period.
Much international trade involves credit. An importer will take credit often for several months and
sometimes longer, and an exporter will grant credit. One consequence of taking and granting credit is that
international traders will know in advance about the receipts and payments arising from their trade. They
will know:




What foreign currency they will receive or pay
When the receipt or payment will occur
How much of the currency will be received or paid

The great danger to profit margins is in the movement in exchange rates. The risk is faced by (i)
exporters who invoice in a foreign currency and (ii) importers who pay in a foreign currency.

Question

Changes in exchange rates

Bulldog Ltd, a US company, buys goods from Redland which cost 100,000 Reds (the local currency). The

What would the actual profit be if the spot rate at the time when the currency is received has

(ii)

Red3.0800 – Red3.0950 per $1?
Red4.0650 – Red4.0800 per $1?

Ignore bank commission charges.

Answer
(a)

Bulldog must buy Reds to pay the supplier, and so the bank is selling Reds. The expected profit is
as follows.
$
Revenue from resale of goods
32,000.00
28,050.49
Less cost of 100,000 Reds in dollars ( 3.5650)

(b)

If the actual spot rate for Bulldog to buy and the bank to sell the Reds is 3.0800, the result
is as follows.
$
Revenue from resale
32,000.00
32,467.53
Less cost (100,000 3.0800)
Loss
(467.53)

(ii)

If the actual spot rate for Bulldog to buy and the bank to sell the Reds is 4.0650, the result
is as follows.
$
Revenue from resale
32,000.00
24,600.25
Less cost (100,000 4.0650)
Profit
7,399.75

This variation in the final dollar cost of the goods (and thus the profit) illustrates the concept of
transaction risk.

2.4 Economic risk
This refers to the effect of exchange rate movements on the international competitiveness of a company
and refers to the effect on the present value of longer-term cash flows.
It is the risk that over time a currency will depreciate or appreciate in value against other currencies, so
that a country's economy becomes more or less competitive.
For example, a UK company might use raw materials which are priced in US dollars, but export its
products mainly within the EU, pricing its exports in sterling. A depreciation of sterling against the dollar
or an appreciation of sterling against other EU currencies will erode the competitiveness of the company.
Economic exposure can be difficult to avoid, although diversification of the supplier and customer base
across different countries will reduce this kind of exposure to risk.

3 The causes of exchange rate fluctuations
3.1 Currency supply and demand
FAST FORWARD

386

Factors influencing the exchange rate include the comparative rates of inflation in different countries
(purchasing power parity), comparative interest rates in different countries (interest rate parity), the
underlying balance of payments, speculation and government policy on managing or fixing exchange rates.

19: Foreign currency risk

Part G Risk management
w


The exchange rate between two currencies – ie the buying and selling rates, both spot and forward – is
determined primarily by supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets. Demand comes from
individuals, firms and governments who want to buy a currency. Supply comes from those who want to
sell it.
Supply and demand for currencies are in turn influenced by:








The rate of inflation, compared with the rate of inflation in other countries
Interest rates, compared with interest rates in other countries
The balance of payments in goods and services
Transactions of a capital nature, such as inward or outward foreign investment
Sentiment of foreign exchange market participants regarding economic prospects
Speculation
Government policy on intervention to influence the exchange rate

3.2 Interest rate parity
Key term

12/14, 6/15, 9/16, 12/16

Interest rate parity is a method of predicting foreign exchange rates based on the hypothesis that the
difference between the interest rates in the two countries should offset the difference between the spot
rates and the forward foreign exchange rates over the same period.
The difference between spot and forward rates reflects differences in interest rates. In other words, the
expected dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the expected dollar return on foreign deposits. If this
were not so, then investors holding the currency with the lower interest rates would switch to the other
currency for (say) three months, ensuring that they would not lose on returning to the original currency by
fixing the exchange rate in advance at the forward rate.

If enough investors acted in this way (known as arbitrage), forces of supply and demand would lead to a
change in the forward rate to prevent such risk-free profit making.
The principle of interest rate parity links the foreign exchange markets and the international money
markets and capital markets. The theory states that over time movements in the spot exchange rate
between two currencies are determined by differences in the interest rates between the two countries.
The principle can be stated as follows.

the exam

F0 = S0

To help apply the formula the following may be useful. If there are two countries, C and B, then country
C's interest rate will be the numerator when the exchange rates are expressed as the quantity of the
currency of C required to purchase one unit of the currency of B. The formula is given in the exam on the
formula sheet.

3.2.1 Example: Interest rate parity
Exchange rates between two currencies, the Northland florin (NF) and the Southland dollar (S$), are listed

90-day forward rates

NF4.7506 per $S1
$S0.21050 per NF1

The money market interest rate for 90-day deposits in Northland florins is 7.5% annualised. What is
implied about interest rates in Southland?
Assume a 365-day year. Note. In practice, foreign currency interest rates are often calculated on an
alternative 360-day basis, one month being treated as 30 days.

Solution
Today, $S1.000 buys NF4.7250.
NF4.7250 could be placed on deposit for 90 days to earn interest of NF(4.7250
NF0.0874, thus growing to NF(4.7250 + 0.0874) = NF4.8124.

0.075

90/365) =

This is then worth $S1.0130 at the 90-day forward exchange rate (4.8124/4.7506).
This tells us that the annualised expected interest rate on 90-day deposits in Southland is 0.013
= 5.3%.

365/90

Alternatively, applying the formula given earlier, we have the following.
Northland interest rate on 90-day deposit = in = 7.5%

90/365 = 1.85%

Southland interest rate on 90-day deposit = is

is = 0.013, or 1.3%
Annualised, this is 0.013

365/90 = 5.3%

3.2.2 Example: Interest rate parity
A Canadian company is expecting to receive Kuwaiti dinars in one year's time. The spot rate is Canadian
dollar 5.4670 per 1 dinar. The company could borrow in dinars at 9% or in Canadian dollars at 14%. There
is no forward rate for one year's time. Predict what the exchange rate is likely to be in one year.

Solution
Using interest rate parity, the Canadian dollar is the numerator and the Kuwaiti dinar is the denominator.
So the expected future exchange rate dollar/dinar is given by:
5.4670

1.14
= 5.7178
1.09

This prediction is subject to great inaccuracy, but note that the company could 'lock into' this exchange
rate, working a money market hedge by borrowing today in dinars at 9%, converting the cash to dollars at
spot and repaying any 14% dollar debt. When the dinar cash is received from the customer, the dinar loan
is repaid.

3.3 Purchasing power parity
Key term

9/16

Purchasing power parity theory states that the exchange rate between two currencies is the same in
equilibrium when the purchasing power of currency is the same in each country.

Interest rate parity should not be confused with purchasing power parity (PPP).
Purchasing power parity theory is an alternative theory for predicting movements in a spot exchange rate
over time.
Purchasing power parity theory predicts that the exchange value of foreign currency depends on the
relative purchasing power of each currency in its own country and that spot exchange rates will vary over
time according to relative price changes.
Formally, purchasing power parity can be expressed in the following formula.

This formula
Exam
formula
is
given in
the exam

S1 = S0

(1 hc )
(1 hb )

Where S1 = expected spot rate
S0 = current spot rate
hc = expected inflation rate in country c (a foreign country)
hb = expected inflation rate in country b (the investor's country)
Note this formula is given in the exam.

Exam focus
point

Try to remember that purchasing power parity predicts the future spot rate and interest rate parity
predicts the forward rate.
Note. The expected future spot rate will not necessarily coincide with the 'forward exchange rate' currently
quoted.

3.4 Example: Purchasing power parity
The spot exchange rate between UK sterling and the Danish krone is £1 = 8.00 kroner. Assuming that
there is now purchasing parity, an amount of a commodity costing £110 in the UK will cost 880 kroner in
Denmark. Over the next year, price inflation in Denmark is expected to be 5% while inflation in the UK is
expected to be 8%. What is the 'expected spot exchange rate' at the end of the year?
Using the formula above:
Future (forward) rate, S1

=8

1.05
1.08

= 7.78
This is the same figure as we get if we compare the inflated prices for the commodity. At the end of the
year:
UK price

=

£110

1.08 = £118.80

Denmark price

=

Kr880

1.05 = Kr924

St

=

924

118.80 = 7.78

In the real world, exchange rates move towards purchasing power parity only over the long term.
However, the theory is sometimes used to predict future exchange rates in investment appraisal
problems where forecasts of relative inflation rates are available.

Part G
w

Risk management

19: Foreign currency risk

389

Case Study
An amusing example of purchasing power parity is The Economist's Big Mac index. Under PPP,
movements in countries' exchange rates should in the long-term mean that the prices of an identical
basket of goods or services are equalised. The McDonalds Big Mac represents this basket.
The index compares local Big Mac prices with the price of Big Macs in America. This comparison is used
to forecast what exchange rates should be, and this is then compared with the actual exchange rates to
decide which currencies are over- and under-valued.
For example, in July 2017, the price of a Big Mac in America was $5.30. At market exchange rates, the
price of a Big Mac in China was $2.92. So the Big Mac index suggests that the yuan was undervalued by
45% at the time.

3.5 The Fisher effect

12/16

The term Fisher effect is sometimes used in looking at the relationship between interest rates and
expected rates of inflation (see Chapter 9, Section 1).
The rate of interest is seen as being made up of two parts: the real required rate of return (real interest
rate) plus a premium for inflation. Then:

Exam
formula

[1 + nominal (money) rate] = [1 + real interest rate] [1 + inflation rate]
(1 + i) = (1 + r)(1 + h)
Countries with relatively high rates of inflation will generally have high nominal rates of interest, partly
because high interest rates are a mechanism for reducing inflation, and partly because of the Fisher effect:
higher nominal interest rates serve to allow investors to obtain a high enough real rate of return where
inflation is relatively high.
According to the international Fisher effect, nominal interest rate differentials between countries provide
an unbiased predictor of future changes in spot exchange rates. The currency of countries with relatively
high interest rates is expected to depreciate against currencies with lower interest rates, because the
higher interest rates are considered necessary to compensate for the anticipated currency depreciation.
Given free movement of capital internationally, this idea suggests that the real rate of return in different
countries will equalise as a result of adjustments to spot exchange rates.
The international Fisher effect can be expressed as:
1 ia
1 ib

1 ha
1 hb

Where ia
ib
ha
hb

is the nominal interest rate in country a
is the nominal interest rate in country b
is the inflation rate in country a
is the inflation rate in country b

3.6 Four-way equivalence

12/15, 9/16, Mar/June 2017

The four-way equivalence model states that in equilibrium, differences between forward and spot rates,
differences in interest rates, expected differences in inflation rates and expected changes in spot rates are
equal to one another.
If interest rates are only different between Country A and Country B due to inflation (ie real interest rates
are the same in both countries) then:

390

19: Foreign currency risk

Part G Risk management
w


(1)

inflation rates can be used to predict the future spot rate (purchasing power parity theory); if
inflation is higher in Country A then the currency in Country A would be expected to devalue
against the currency in Country B, and

(2)

long-term interest rates can also be used to predict the future spot rate (international fisher effect);
if nominal interest rates are higher in Country A then the currency in Country A would be expected
to devalue against the currency in Country B.

It is also logical to assume that if short-term interest rate differences explain the differences between the
forward rate and the spot rate then over the long-term this is can also be seen as an unbiased indicator of
expected changes in the spot rate.
In other words the theories that we have been examining are linked. This is shown graphically below.

4 Foreign currency risk management
FAST FORWARD

12/14, 12/16

Foreign currency risk can be managed, in order to reduce or eliminate the risk. Measures to reduce
currency risk are known as 'hedging'.
Basic methods of hedging risk include matching receipts and payments, invoicing in own currency, and
leading and lagging the times that cash is received and paid. Other common hedging methods are the
use of forward exchange contracts and money market hedging.

4.1 Risk and risk management
Risk management describes the policies which a firm may adopt and the techniques it may use to
manage the risks it faces. Exposure means being open to or vulnerable to risk. If entrepreneurship is
about risk, why should businesses want to 'manage' risk? Broadly, there are two reasons why risk
management makes good business sense.

(a)

Firstly, a business may wish to reduce risks to which it is exposed to acceptable levels. What is an
acceptable level of risk may depend on various factors, including the scale of operations of the
business and the degree to which its proprietors or shareholders are risk averse.

(b)

Secondly, a business may wish to avoid particular kinds of risks. For example, a business may be
averse to taking risks with exchange rates. The reasons may include the fact that the risks are
simply too great for the business to bear, for example if adverse exchange rate movements could
easily wipe out the expected profit on business transactions.

4.2 Currency of invoice
One way of avoiding exchange risk is for exporters to invoice their foreign customer in their domestic
currency, or for importers to arrange with their foreign supplier to be invoiced in their domestic
currency. However, although either the exporter or the importer can avoid the transaction risk through
invoicing in domestic currency, only one of them can do it. The other must deal in a foreign currency and
must accept the exchange risk. This is the risk of adverse movement in the exchange rate up to the date of
settlement of the invoice.

Part G
w

Risk management

19: Foreign currency risk

391

For example, if a UK exporter is able to quote and invoice an overseas buyer in sterling, then the foreign
exchange risk is in effect transferred to the overseas buyer.
An alternative method of achieving the same result is to negotiate contracts expressed in the foreign
currency but specifying a fixed rate of exchange as a condition of the contract.
There are certain advantages in invoicing in a foreign currency which might persuade an exporter to take
on the exchange risk.
(a)

There is the possible marketing advantage by proposing to invoice in the buyer's own currency,
when there is competition for the sales contract.

(b)

The exporter may also be able to offset payments to their own suppliers in a particular foreign
currency against receipts in that currency.

(c)

By arranging to sell goods to customers in a foreign currency, an exporter might be able to obtain
a loan in that currency, and at the same time obtain cover against exchange risks by arranging to
repay the loan out of the proceeds from the sales in that currency.

4.3 Matching receipts and payments
A company may be able to reduce or eliminate its foreign exchange transaction exposure by matching
receipts and payments in a foreign currency. Wherever possible, a company that expects to make
payments and have receipts in the same foreign currency should plan to offset its payments against its
receipts in the currency.
Since the company will be setting off foreign currency receipts against foreign currency payments, it does
not matter whether the currency strengthens or weakens against the company's 'domestic' currency
because there will be no purchase or sale of the currency.
The process of matching receipts and payments is made possible by having one or more foreign currency
accounts with a bank. Receipts of the foreign currency can be paid into the account, and payments made
from the account.

4.4 Matching assets and liabilities
A company which expects to receive a substantial amount of income in a foreign currency will be
concerned that this currency may weaken. It can hedge against this possibility by borrowing in the foreign
currency and using the foreign receipts to repay the loan. For example, receivables in euros can be hedged
by taking out a euro overdraft. In the same way, euro trade payables can be matched against a euro bank
account which is used to pay the suppliers.
A company which has a long-term foreign investment, for example an overseas subsidiary, may also try to
match its foreign assets (property, plant, etc) by a long-term loan in the foreign currency. This would
reduce its risk from translation exposure.

4.5 Leading and lagging
In order to take advantage of foreign exchange rate movements, companies might try to use:


Lead payments (payments in advance for goods purchased in a foreign currency)



Lagged payments (delaying payments beyond their due date for goods purchased in a foreign
currency)

Payments in a foreign currency may be made in advance when the company expects the foreign currency
to increase in value up to the settlement date for the transaction.
With a lead payment, paying in advance of the due date, there is a finance cost to consider. This is the
interest cost on the money used to make the payment, but early settlement discounts may be available.

392

19: Foreign currency risk

Part G Risk management
w


Payments in a foreign currency may be delayed until after the due settlement date when it is expected that
the currency will soon fall in value. However, delaying payments and taking more than the agreed amount
of credit is questionable business practice.

4.6 Netting
Unlike matching, netting is not technically a method of managing exchange risk. However, it is
conveniently dealt with at this stage. The objective is simply to save transactions costs by netting off
inter-company balances before arranging payment. Many multinational groups of companies engage in
intra-group trading. Where related companies located in different countries trade with one another, there
is likely to be inter-company indebtedness denominated in different currencies.

Key term

Netting is a process in which credit balances are netted off against debit balances so that only the reduced
net amounts remain due to be paid by actual currency flows.

Netting has the following advantages.
(a)

Foreign exchange purchase costs, including commission and the spread between selling and
buying rates, and money transmission costs are reduced.

(b)

There is less loss in interest from having money in transit.

Local laws and regulations need to be considered before netting is used, as netting is restricted by some
countries.

4.6.1 Example: Netting
A and B are respectively UK- and US-based subsidiaries of a Swiss-based holding company. At 31 March
20X5, A owed B CHF300,000 and B owed A CHF220,000. Netting can reduce the value of the
inter-company debts: the two inter-company balances are set against each other, leaving a net debt owed
by A to B of CHF 80,000 (CHF300,000 220,000).

4.7 Forward exchange contracts
FAST FORWARD

12/14, Sep/Dec 15, Mar/Jun 16

A forward exchange contract is a contract made now for the purchase or sale of a quantity of currency in
exchange for another currency, for settlement at a future date, and at a rate of exchange that is fixed in the
contract.
A forward contract therefore fixes in advance the rate at which a specified quantity of currency will be
bought and sold.

4.7.1 The purpose of forward contracts
The purpose of a forward contract is to fix an exchange rate now for the settlement of a transaction at a
future date. This removes uncertainty about what the exchange rate will be at the future date.
Currency risk is a two-way risk. By arranging a forward contract, a company can hedge against the risk of
an adverse movement in the spot exchange rate up to the date of settlement, but at the same time it loses
the opportunity to gain from a favourable movement in the spot rate.
Forward contracts can be arranged for settlement up to several months ahead, or possibly as much as one
year ahead, depending on the nature of the money markets in the two currencies. They may therefore be
used to manage exposures to transaction risk, but cannot be used as a hedge against currency risk in the
long term.
Forward contracts are arranged directly with a bank, and are sometimes referred to as over-the-counter or
OTC transactions.

4.7.2 Forward exchange rates
Forward exchange rates are determined by the current spot rate and differences in interest rates between
the two currencies.
A forward exchange rate may be higher or lower than the spot rate. When a currency is more expensive
forward than spot, it is quoted forward 'at a premium' to the spot rate. When a currency is cheaper
forward than spot, it is quoted forward 'at a discount' to the spot rate.
For example, suppose that:



The spot rate for Swiss francs is CHF1.4460 – CHF1.4560 per $1, and
The three-month forward rate is CHF1.4680 – CHF1.4800 per $1.

(a)

A bank would sell 20,000 Swiss francs:

(b)

(i)

At the spot rate, now, for (20,000/1.4460) $13,831.26

(ii)

Under a forward contract for settlement in three months' time, for (20,000/1.4680)
$13,623.98

A bank would buy 20,000 Swiss francs:
(i)

At the spot rate, for (20,000/1.4560) $13,736.26

(ii)

Under a forward contract for settlement in three months' time, for (20,000/1.4800)
$13,513.51

In both cases, the quoted currency (Swiss franc) would be quoted forward at a discount to the spot rate.
The forward rate can be calculated today without making any estimates of future exchange rates. Future
exchange rates depend largely on future events and will often turn out to be very different from the
forward rate. However, the forward rate is probably an unbiased predictor of the expected value of the
future exchange rate, based on the information available today. It is also likely that the spot rate will move
in the direction indicated by the forward rate.

4.7.3 Forward exchange contracts
Forward exchange contracts are legally binding contracts. They hedge against transaction exposure by
allowing the importer or exporter to arrange for a bank to sell or buy a quantity of foreign currency at a
future date, at a rate of exchange determined when the forward contract is made. The trader will know in
advance either how much local currency they will receive (if they are selling foreign currency to the bank)
or how much local currency they must pay (if they are buying foreign currency from the bank).
Forward contracts are very popular with small companies as a method of hedging currency risk and taking
away uncertainty about the exchange rate. The current spot price is irrelevant to the outcome of a forward
contract.

Key term

A forward exchange contract is defined as:
(a)

An immediately firm and binding contract, eg between a bank and its customer

(b)

For the purchase or sale of a specified quantity of a stated foreign currency

(c)

At a rate of exchange fixed at the time the contract is made

(d)

For performance (delivery of the currency and payment for it) at a future time which is agreed when
making the contract. (This future time will be either a specified date, or any time between two
specified dates.)

4.7.4 Example: Forward exchange contracts (1)
A US importer knows on 1 April that they must pay a foreign seller 26,500 Swiss francs in one month's
time, on 1 May. They can arrange a one-month forward exchange contract with the bank on 1 April,

394

19: Foreign currency risk

Part G Risk management
w


whereby the bank undertakes to sell the importer 26,500 Swiss francs. The bank's forward rates for one
month are:
CHF/$1

1.4396 – 1.4504

Because the importer is buying Swiss francs and the bank is selling the francs, the appropriate rate is
1.4396.
The US importer can be certain that whatever the spot rate is on 1 May, they will have to pay at this
forward rate. The cost in dollars will be:
(26,500/1.4396) = $18,407.89.
(a)

If the spot rate is lower than 1.4396 on 1 May, the importer would have successfully protected
themselves against a fall in the value of the dollar, and would have avoided paying more dollars at the
spot rate to obtain the Swiss francs.

(b)

If the spot rate is higher than 1.4396 on 1 May, the importer would pay more at the forward rate
than if they had obtained the francs at the spot rate on 1 May. They cannot avoid this extra cost
because a forward contract is binding.

4.7.5 What happens if a customer cannot satisfy a forward contract?
A company may arrange a forward contract and then subsequently discover that it does not need to buy or
sell the currency.
(a)

(b)

An importer might find that:
(i)

Their supplier fails to deliver the goods as specified, so the importer will not accept the
goods delivered and will not agree to pay for them.

(ii)

The supplier sends fewer goods than expected, perhaps because of supply shortages, and
so the importer has less to pay for.

(iii)

The supplier is late with the delivery, and so the importer does not have to pay for the
goods until later than expected.

An exporter might experience the same types of situation, but in reverse, so that they do not
receive any payment at all, or they receive more or less than originally expected, or they receive the
expected amount, but only after some delay.

4.7.6 Close-out of forward contracts
If a customer cannot satisfy a forward exchange contract, the bank will make the customer fulfil the
contract.
(a)

(b)

If the customer has arranged for the bank to buy currency but then cannot deliver the currency for
the bank to buy, the bank will:
(i)

Sell currency to the customer at the spot rate (when the contract falls due for
performance)

(ii)

Buy the currency back, under the terms of the forward exchange contract

If the customer has contracted for the bank to sell them currency, the bank will:
(i)
Sell the customer the specified amount of currency at the forward exchange rate
Buy back the unwanted currency at the spot rate
(ii)

Thus, the bank arranges for the customer to perform their part of the forward exchange contract by either
selling or buying the 'missing' currency at the spot rate. These arrangements are known as closing out a
forward exchange contract.

4.8 Money market hedging
FAST FORWARD

12/14, 6/15, Mar/Jun 16, 12/16

Money market hedging involves borrowing in one currency, converting the money borrowed into another
currency and putting the money on deposit until the time the transaction is completed, hoping to take
advantage of favourable exchange rate movements.

Because of the close relationship between forward exchange rates and the interest rates in two currencies,
it is possible to 'manufacture' a forward rate by using the spot exchange rate and money market lending
or borrowing. This technique is known as a money market hedge or synthetic forward.

4.8.1 Setting up a money market hedge for a foreign currency payment
Suppose a US company needs to pay a supplier in Swiss francs in three months' time. It does not have
enough cash to pay now, but will do in three months' time. Instead of negotiating a forward contract, the
company could:

Step 1
Step 2
Step 3
Step 4

Borrow the appropriate amount in dollars now.
Convert the dollars to francs immediately at the spot rate.
Put the francs on deposit in a Swiss franc bank account.
When the time comes to pay the company:
(a)
(b)

Pay the supplier out of the franc bank account.
Repay the dollar loan.

The effect is exactly the same as using a forward contract, and will usually cost almost exactly the same
amount. If the results from a money market hedge were very different from a forward hedge, speculators
could make money without taking a risk. Market forces therefore ensure that the two hedges produce very
similar results.
This transaction is called a money market hedge because the company is borrowing and investing in the
money markets to create the currency hedge.

4.8.2 Example: Money market hedge (1)
A US company owes a Danish supplier Kr3,500,000 which is payable in three months' time. The spot
exchange rate is Kr7.5509 – Kr7.5548 per $1. The company can borrow in dollars for three months at
8.60% per annum and can deposit kroner for three months at 10% per annum.
What is the cost in dollars with a money market hedge and what effective forward rate would this
represent?

Solution
The interest rates for three months are 2.15% (= 8.60%/4) to borrow in dollars and 2.5% (= 10%/4) to
deposit in kroner. The company needs to deposit enough kroner now so that the total including interest
will be Kr3,500,000 in three months' time. This means depositing:
Kr3,500,000/(1 + 0.025) = Kr3,414,634.
These kroner will cost $452,215 (spot rate Kr7.5509 = $1). The company must borrow this amount and,
with three months' interest at 2.15%, will have to repay:
$452,215

(1 + 0.0215) = $461,938.

Thus, in three months, the Danish supplier will be paid out of the Danish bank account and the company
will effectively be paying $461,938 to satisfy this debt. The effective forward rate which the company has
'manufactured' is 3,500,000/461,938 = Kr7.5768 = $1. This effective forward rate shows the krone at a
discount to the dollar because the krone interest rate is higher than the dollar interest rate.

4.8.3 Setting up a money market hedge for a foreign currency receipt
A similar technique can be used to cover a foreign currency receipt from a trade receivable. To
manufacture a forward exchange rate, follow the steps below.

Step 1
Step 2
Step 3
Step 4

Borrow an appropriate amount in the foreign currency today.
Convert it immediately to home currency at the spot rate.
Place this on deposit in the home currency.
When the receivable's cash is received:
(a)
Repay the foreign currency loan.
(b)
Take the cash from the home currency deposit account.

4.8.4 Example: Money market hedge (2)
A US company is owed CHF 2,500,000, receivable in three months' time from a Swiss company. The spot
exchange rate is CHF1.4498 – CHF1.4510 per $1. The company can deposit in dollars for three months at
8.00% per annum and can borrow Swiss francs for three months at 7.00% per annum.
What is the receipt in dollars with a money market hedge and what effective forward rate would this
represent?

Solution
The interest rates for three months are 2.00% to deposit in dollars and 1.75% to borrow in Swiss francs.
The company should borrow CHF2,500,000/1.0175 = CHF 2,457,002 today. After three months, CHF
2,500,000 will be repayable, including interest.
These Swiss francs will be converted to $ at 2,457,002/1.4510 = $1,693,316. The company must deposit
this amount for three months, when it will have increased in value with interest (2% for the three months) to:
$1,693,316

1.02 = $1,727,182

Thus, in three months, the loan will be repaid out of the proceeds from the trade receivable and the
company will receive $1,727,182. The effective forward rate which the company has 'manufactured' is
2,500,000/1,727,182 = CHF1.4474 = $1. This effective forward rate shows the Swiss franc at a premium
to the dollar because the Swiss franc interest rate is lower than the dollar rate.

4.9 Choosing between a forward contract and a money market hedge
FAST FORWARD

The choice between a forward contract and a money market hedge is generally made on the basis of which
method is cheaper, with other factors being of limited significance.

4.9.1 Choosing the hedging method
When a company expects to receive or pay a sum of foreign currency in the next few months, it can
choose between using the forward exchange market and the money market to hedge against the foreign
exchange risk. Other methods may also be possible, such as making lead payments. The cheapest
method available is the one that ought to be chosen.
Often, the costs of using a forward contract and money market hedge are very similar. In such cases,
transaction costs must be considered.

4.9.2 Example: Choosing the cheapest method
Trumpton, a US company, has bought goods from a foreign supplier, and must pay 4,000,000 peso for
them in three months' time. The company's finance director wishes to hedge against the foreign exchange
risk, and the three methods which the company usually considers are:


Which is the cheapest method for Trumpton?

Solution
The three choices must be compared on a similar basis, which means working out the cost of each to
Trumpton either now or in three months' time. In the following paragraphs, the cost to Trumpton now will
be determined.

398

19: Foreign currency risk

Part G Risk management
w


Choice 1: The forward exchange market
Trumpton must buy pesos in order to pay the foreign supplier. The exchange rate in a forward exchange
contract to buy 4,000,000 peso in 3 months' time (bank sells) is 1.8424 = $1.
The cost of the 4,000,000 peso to Trumpton in three months' time will be:
4,000,000
= $2,171,081
1.8424
This is the cost in three months.

Choice 2: The money markets
Using the money markets involves:
(a)

Borrowing in the foreign currency, if the company will eventually receive that currency

(b)

Lending (Ie investing) in the foreign currency, if the company will eventually pay the currency.
Here, Trumpton will pay 4,000,000 peso and so it would invest in pesos.

It would invest enough pesos for three months, so that the principal repaid in three months' time plus
interest will amount to the payment due of 4,000,000 pesos.
(a)

Since the peso deposit rate is 2.80%, the rate for 3 months is approximately 2.80/4 = 0.70%.

(b)

To earn 4,000,000 pesos in three months' time at 0.70% interest, Trumpton would have to invest
(ie lend) now:
4,000,000
= 3,972,195 peso
1.007

These pesos would have to be purchased now at the spot rate of (bank sells) 1.8625 = $1. The cost today
would be:
3,972,195
= $2,132,722
1.8625
However, to compare this to a forward contract we need to assess the cost in three months' time (the date
at which the forward contract occurs).
Assuming that Trumpton starts with a zero cash flow position (a reasonable assumption unless an exam
question specifies otherwise) then the $2,132,722 would need to be borrowed. This would incur interest
costs in the US of 7.2% per annum so approximately 7.2 3/12 = 1.80% over three months. The cost in
three months' time is therefore $2,132,722 1.018 = $2,171,111.
By investing in pesos for three months, Trumpton is matching eventual receipts and payments in pesos,
and so has hedged against foreign exchange risk.

Choice 3: Lead payments
Lead payments should be considered when the currency of payment is expected to strengthen over time,
and is quoted forward at a premium on the foreign exchange market. Here, the cost of a lead payment
(paying 4,000,000 pesos now) would be 4,000,000 ÷ 1.8625 = $2,147,651
Again, assuming that Trumpton starts with a zero cash flow position, then this would need to be
borrowed. This would incur interest costs in the US of 7.2% per annum so approximately 7.2 3/12 =
1.80% over three months. The cost in three months' time is therefore $2,147,651 1.018 = $2,186,309.

5 Foreign currency derivatives
FAST FORWARD

Foreign currency derivatives can be used to hedge foreign currency risk. Futures contracts, options and
swaps are types of derivative.

5.1 Currency futures
FAST FORWARD

Currency futures are standardised contracts for the sale or purchase at a set future date of a set quantity
of currency.

Currency futures can be used to hedge currency risk in the same way as forward contracts. Futures are
exchange-traded instruments whereas forward contracts are over the counter transactions. Forward
contracts are used much more extensively than currency futures.

Key term

A currency future is a standardised, market-traded contract to buy or sell a specified quantity of foreign
currency.
The following table summarises the differences between currency futures and forward contracts.
Currency futures

Flexible close out dates

Fixed date of settlement

Underlying transactions take place at the spot rate;
the difference between the spot rate and futures

rate

Cheaper than forwards

Relatively high premium required

A futures market is an exchange-traded market for the purchase or sale of a standard quantity of an
underlying item, such as currencies, commodities or shares, for settlement at a future date and at an
agreed price.

The contract size is the fixed minimum quantity of commodity which can be bought or sold using a
futures contract. In general, dealing on futures markets must be in a whole number of contracts.
The settlement date (or delivery date, or expiry date) is the date when trading on a particular futures
contract stops and all accounts are settled. On the International Monetary Market (IMM), the settlement
dates for all currency futures are at the end of March, June, September and December.
A future's price may be different from the spot price, and this difference is the basis.
Basis = Futures price – Spot price

One tick is the smallest measured movement in the contract price. For currency futures this is a
movement in the fourth decimal place.
Market traders will compute gains or losses on their futures positions by reference to the number of ticks
by which the contract price has moved.

Current spot is $0.9215 – $0.9221 per €1 and the € futures rate is $0.9245 per €1.
The standard size of a three-month € futures contract is €125,000.
In 30 days' time the spot is $0.9345 – $0.9351 per €1.

futures contract does not have to be closed out until the actual cash receipt or payment is made.

5.1.3 Disadvantages of futures
(a)

The contracts cannot be tailored to the user's exact requirements.

(b)

Hedge inefficiencies are caused by having to deal in a whole number of contracts and by basis
risk (the risk that the futures contract price may move by a different amount from the price of the
underlying currency or commodity).

(c)

Only a limited number of currencies are the subject of futures contracts (although the number of
currencies is growing, especially with the rapid development of Asian economies).

(d)

Unlike options (see below), they do not allow a company to take advantage of favourable currency
movements.

5.2 Currency options
FAST FORWARD

Key term

Currency options protect against adverse exchange rate movements while allowing the investor to take
advantage of favourable exchange rate movements. They are particularly useful in situations where the
cash flow is not certain to occur (eg when tendering for overseas contracts).

A currency option is a right of an option holder to buy (call) or sell (put) a quantity of one currency in
exchange for another, at a specific exchange rate (the exercise rate, exercise price or strike price) on or
before a future expiry date. If a buyer exercises the option, the option seller must sell or buy at this rate.
If an option is not exercised, it lapses at the expiry date.
The exercise price for the option may be the same as the current spot rate, or it may be more favourable
or less favourable to the option holder than the current spot rate.
Companies can choose whether to buy:
(a)

A tailor-made currency option from a bank, suited to the company's specific needs. These are over
the counter (OTC) or negotiated options; or

(b)

A standard option, in certain currencies only, from an options exchange. Such options are traded
or exchange-traded options.

Because of the flexibility offered by currency options – the holder can exercise the option at any point, or
choose to sell the option – it allows the holder to enjoy the upside without a risk of suffering the downside.
However, buying a currency option involves paying a premium to the option seller. The option premium
is a cost of using an option. It is the most the buyer of the option can lose by hedging an exposure to
currency risk with an option: this maximum loss occurs if the option is not exercised, but is allowed to
lapse.

5.2.1 Example: Currency options
Exam focus
point

You will not be expected to do options calculations in the exam but the following example will help you to
understand how they work.
Currency options will be exercised by the option holder only if the exercise rate in the option is more
favourable than the spot rate at the exercise date for the option.
For example, a company may buy a currency call option, giving it the right to buy €6,000,000 in 2 months'
time in exchange for dollars at an exercise rate of €1.5000 per $. Buying the euros at this rate would cost
$4,000,000.

402

(a)

If the spot exchange rate at the exercise date is €1.60, the option holder will let the option lapse
and will buy the euros at the spot rate for $3,750,000.

(b)

If the spot exchange rate at the exercise date is €1.40, the option holder will exercise the option
and will buy the euros at the exercise rate of €1.50. (Buying at the spot rate would cost
$4,285,714.)

19: Foreign currency risk

Part G Risk management
w


Similarly, a company may buy a currency put option, giving it the right to sell €2,800,000 in 2 months'
time in exchange for dollars at an exercise rate of €1.4000. The euros could be sold at this rate for
$2,000,000.
(a)

If the spot exchange rate at the exercise date is €1.35, the option holder will let the option lapse
and will sell the euros at the spot rate for $2,074,074.

(b)

If the spot exchange rate at the exercise date is €1.45, the option holder will exercise the option
and will sell the euros at the exercise rate of €1.40. (Selling at the spot rate would earn
$1,931,034.)

5.2.2 The purposes of currency options
The purpose of currency options is to reduce or eliminate exposure to currency risks, and they are
particularly useful for companies in the following situations.
(a)

Where there is uncertainty about foreign currency receipts or payments, either in timing or
amount. Should the foreign exchange transaction not materialise, the option can be sold on the
market (if it has any value) or exercised if this would make a profit.

(b)

To support the tender for an overseas contract by a company, priced in a foreign currency. The
option would be to sell the currency earned from the contract. If the company does not win the
contract, it can let the option lapse (or make a profit on a favourable movement in the spot rate). In
this situation, an option would be preferable to a binding forward contract, because it does not
know whether or not it will need to sell any currency.

(c)

To allow the publication of price lists for its goods in a foreign currency. A company can arrange
a number of currency options to sell a quantity of the foreign currency in exchange for its domestic
currency, covering the time period for which the price list remains valid.

In both situations (b) and (c), the company would not know whether it had won any export sales or would
have any foreign currency income at the time that it announces its selling prices. It cannot make a forward
exchange contract to sell foreign currency without becoming exposed in the currency.

5.2.3 Drawbacks of currency options






They have a cost (the 'option premium'). The cost depends on the expected volatility of the
exchange rate, the choice of exercise rate and the length of time to the expiry date for the
option.
Options must be paid for as soon as they are bought.
Tailor-made options (arranged over the counter with a bank) lack negotiability.
Traded options are not available in every currency.

5.3 Currency swaps
FAST FORWARD

Currency swaps effectively involve the exchange of debt from one currency to another.

Currency swaps can provide a hedge against exchange rate movements for longer periods than the
forward market, and can be a means of obtaining finance from new countries.

Key term

A swap is a formal agreement whereby two organisations contractually agree to exchange payments on
different terms, eg in different currencies, or one at a fixed rate and the other at a floating rate.
In a currency swap, the parties agree to swap equivalent amounts of currency for a period. This effectively
involves the exchange of debt from one currency to another. Liability on the main debt (the principal) is
not transferred and the parties are liable to counterparty risk: if the other party defaults on the agreement
to pay interest, the original borrower remains liable to the lender.

of buying another French wine company. At the same time, the French subsidiary Y wishes to raise £1m to
pay for new up to date capital equipment imported from the UK. The UK parent company X could borrow
the £1m sterling and the French subsidiary Y could borrow the 1.2 million euros, each effectively
borrowing on the other's behalf. They would then swap currencies.

5.3.1 Benefits of currency swaps
(a)

Swaps are easy to arrange and are flexible since they can be arranged in any size.

(b)

Transaction costs are low, only amounting to legal fees, since there is no commission or premium
to be paid.

(c)

The parties can obtain the currency they require without subjecting themselves to the
uncertainties of the spot foreign exchange markets.

(d)

The company can gain access to debt finance in another country and currency where it is little
known, and consequently has a poorer credit rating, than in its home country. It can therefore take
advantage of lower interest rates than it could obtain if it arranged the currency loan itself.

(e)

Currency swaps may be used to restructure the currency base of the company's liabilities. This
may be important where the company is trading overseas and receiving revenues in foreign
currencies, but its borrowings are denominated in the currency of its home country. Currency
swaps therefore provide a means of reducing exchange rate exposure.

(f)

A currency swap could be used to absorb excess liquidity in one currency which is not needed
immediately in order to create funds in another where there is a need.

In practice, most currency swaps are conducted between banks and their customers. An agreement
should only be necessary if the swap were for longer than, say, one year. For shorter periods, a forward
exchange contract should be arranged if a currency hedge is required.

Edted, a UK company, wishes to invest in Germany. It borrows £20m from its bank and
pays interest at 5%. To invest in Germany, the £20m will be converted into euros at a spot
rate of £1 = €1.30. The earnings from the German investment will be in euros, but Edted will
have to pay interest on the swap. The company arranges to swap the £20m for €26m with
Gordonbear, a company in the euro currency zone. Gordonbear is thus the counterparty in
this transaction. Interest of 6% is payable on the €26m. Edted can use the €26m it receives
to invest in Germany.

Chapter Roundup


Currency risk is the risk of changes in an exchange rate or in the foreign exchange value of a currency. It
is a two-way risk.



Currency risk occurs in three forms: transaction exposure (effect on short-term cash flows), economic
exposure (effect on present value of longer-term cash flows) and translation exposure (gains or losses in
the value of foreign currency assets or liabilities).



Factors influencing the exchange rate include the comparative rates of inflation in different countries
(purchasing power parity), comparative interest rates in different countries (interest rate parity), the
underlying balance of payments, speculation and government policy on managing or fixing exchange rates.



Foreign currency risk can be managed, in order to reduce or eliminate the risk. Measures to reduce
currency risk are known as 'hedging'.
Basic methods of hedging risk include matching receipts and payments, invoicing in own currency, and
leading and lagging the times that cash is received and paid. Other common hedging methods are the
use of forward exchange contracts and money market hedging.



A forward exchange contract is a contract made now for the purchase or sale of a quantity of currency in
exchange for another currency, for settlement at a future date, and at a rate of exchange that is fixed in the
contract.
A forward contract therefore fixes in advance the rate at which a specified quantity of currency will be
bought and sold.



Money market hedging involves borrowing in one currency, converting the money borrowed into another
currency and putting the money on deposit until the time the transaction is completed, hoping to take
advantage of favourable exchange rate movements.



The choice between a forward contract and a money market hedge is generally made on the basis of which
method is cheaper, with other factors being of limited significance.



Foreign currency derivatives can be used to hedge foreign currency risk. Futures contracts, options and
swaps are types of derivative.



Currency futures are standardised contracts for the sale or purchase at a set future date of a set quantity
of currency.



Currency options protect against adverse exchange rate movements while allowing the investor to take
advantage of favourable exchange rate movements. They are particularly useful in situations where the
cash flow is not certain to occur (eg when tendering for overseas contracts).



Currency swaps effectively involve the exchange of debt from one currency to another.

Currency swaps can provide a hedge against exchange rate movements for longer periods than the
forward market, and can be a means of obtaining finance from new countries.

1 Interest rates
FAST FORWARD

The interest rates on financial assets are influenced by the risk of the assets, the duration of the lending,
and the size of the loan.
There is a trade-off between risk and return. Investors in riskier assets expect to be compensated for the
risk.
Interest rates are effectively prices for lending and costs for borrowing. We discussed interest rates in
Section 4 of Chapter 3.

2 Interest rate risk

Mar/Jun 16

Performance objective 11 requires you to 'advise on using instruments or techniques to manage financial
risk'. This chapter covers the management of interest rate risk.

FAST FORWARD

Interest rate risk relates to the sensitivity of profit and cash flows to changes in interest rates.
Interest rate risk is faced by companies with floating (variable) and fixed rate debt. It can arise from gap
exposure and basis risk.

410

20: Interest rate risk

Part G Risk management
w


Interest rate risk is the risk of a change in interest rates, and the effect that this will have on profits and
cash flows. This type of risk is greatest for organisations with large amounts of assets that yield interest or
liabilities on which interest is payable. Banks and investment institutions are therefore heavily exposed to
interest rate risk, but so too are companies with large borrowings.
An organisation will need to analyse how its profits and cash flows might be affected by changes in
interest rates and decide whether to take action to hedge the exposure to the risk.

2.1 Floating interest rate debt
The most common form of interest rate risk faced by a non-bank company is the volatility of cash flows
associated with a high proportion of floating interest rate debt (also known as variable interest rate debt).
Interest rates on this debt will rise or fall in line with changes in a benchmark interest rate, such as the
bank's base rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
Some interest rate risks to which a firm is exposed may cancel each other out, where it has both assets
and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. If interest rates rise, more interest will be
payable on loans and other liabilities, but this will be compensated for by higher interest received on
assets, such as money market deposits.

2.2 Fixed interest rate debt
A company with a high proportion of fixed interest rate debt has a commitment to fixed interest payments.
If interest rates fall sharply, the company will suffer from a loss of competitive advantage compared with
companies using floating rate borrowing whose interest costs and cost of capital will fall.
This means that a company with fixed rate debt has exposure to interest rate risk, just as a company with
floating rate debt is exposed to interest rate risk.

2.3 Gap exposure
The degree to which a firm is exposed to interest rate risk can be identified by using the method of gap
analysis. Gap analysis is based on the principle of grouping together assets and liabilities which are
sensitive to interest rate changes according to their maturity dates. Two different types of 'gap' may occur.
(a)

A negative gap
A negative gap occurs when a firm has a larger amount of interest-sensitive liabilities maturing at a
certain time or in a certain period than it has interest-sensitive assets maturing at the same time.
The difference between the two amounts indicates the net exposure.

(b)

A positive gap
There is a positive gap if the amount of interest-sensitive assets maturing at a particular time
exceeds the amount of interest-sensitive liabilities maturing at the same time.

With a negative gap, the company faces exposure if interest rates rise by the time of maturity. With a
positive gap, the company will lose out if interest rates fall by maturity.

2.4 Basis risk
It may appear that a company which has size-matched assets and liabilities, and is both receiving and
paying interest, may not have any interest rate exposure. However, the two floating rates may not be
determined using the same basis or benchmark. For example, one loan may be linked to one-month
LIBOR and the other to six-month LIBOR.

Key term

LIBOR or the London Interbank Offered Rate is the rate of interest applying to wholesale money market
lending between London banks. There are different LIBOR rates for loans and deposits with different
maturities.

wPart G

Risk management

20: Interest rate risk

411

Basis risk makes it unlikely that the two floating rates will move perfectly in line with each other. As one
rate increases, the other rate may change by a different amount or may change later.

3 The causes of interest rate fluctuations
FAST FORWARD

The causes of interest rate fluctuations include the structure of interest rates and yield curves and
changing economic factors.

3.1 The structure of interest rates

6/15, Mar/Jun 16, 12/16

There are several reasons why interest rates differ in different markets and market segments.
(a)

Risk
Higher risk borrowers must pay higher rates on their borrowing, to compensate lenders for the
greater risk involved. For example, governments can borrow at lower rates than companies,
because lending to government is generally considered a much lower risk. Similarly, lending to a
large listed company is less risky than lending to a small start-up business, and large companies
can therefore borrow at a much lower cost.

(b)

The need to make a profit on re-lending
Financial intermediaries make their profits from re-lending at a higher rate of interest than the cost
of their borrowing.

(c)

The size of the loan
Deposits above a certain amount with a bank or building society may attract higher rates of interest
than smaller deposits.

(d)

Different types of financial asset
Different types of financial asset attract different rates of interest. This is largely because of the
competition for deposits between different types of financial institution.

(e)

The duration of the lending. This is discussed below.

3.1.1 The term structure of interest rates
The term structure of interest rates refers to the way in which the yield on a security varies according to
the term of the borrowing. The interest rate for different maturities of a debt security can be shown
graphically in a yield curve.

412

(a)

Normally, the longer the term to maturity, the higher the rate of interest. This is shown by the
normal yield curve in the diagram below.

(b)

Occasionally, interest rates may be higher for short-term maturities than longer-term maturities.
When this happens, there is a negative yield curve, which is also illustrated in the diagram below.

There are several different reasons why interest rates on a debt security or loan may differ for different
maturities.
(a)

Liquidity preference theory provides a reason why, in theory, the yield curve is normally upward
sloping, so that long-term financial assets offer a higher yield than short-term assets.
Liquidity preference means that investors prefer having cash now to deferring the use of the cash
by lending or investing it. Investors also prefer having cash sooner to having cash later. They
therefore want compensation in the form of a higher return for being unable to use their cash now.
The required return increases with the length of time for which the cash is unavailable. Because of
this, long-term interest rates, such as bond yields, tend to be higher than short-term yields, and the
yield curve slopes upward.

(b)

Expectations theory states that interest rates reflect expectations of future changes in interest
rates. If interest rates are expected to rise in the future, the yield curve will slope upwards. When
interest rates are expected to fall, short-term rates may be higher than long-term rates, and the
yield curve downward sloping. Thus, the shape of the yield curve gives an indication about how
interest rates are expected to move in the future.

(c)

The market segmentation theory of interest rates suggests that the slope of the yield curve will
reflect conditions in different segments of the market. This theory holds that the major investors
are confined to a particular segment of the market and will not switch segment even if the forecast
of likely future interest rates changes.

(d)

Government policy on interest rates may be significant too. A government policy of keeping
interest rates relatively high may have the effect of forcing short-term interest rates higher than
long-term rates. Similarly, a government may have a policy of very low short-term interest rates. In
the US, the eurozone and the UK, the central banks are responsible for managing short-term
interest rates, through the rates at which the central bank lends to banks.

3.2 The general level of interest rates
Interest rates on any one type of financial asset will vary over time. In other words, the general level of
interest rates might go up or down. The general level of interest rates is affected by several factors.
(a)

Need for a real return
Investors normally want to earn a 'real' rate of return on their investment. The appropriate 'real'
rate of return will depend on such factors as investment risk.

(b)

Inflation
Nominal rates of interest should be sufficient to cover expected rates of inflation over the term of
the investment and to provide a real return.

wPart G

Risk management

20: Interest rate risk

413

(c)

Uncertainty about future rates of inflation
When investors are uncertain about inflation and therefore about what future nominal and real
interest rates will be, they are likely to require higher interest yields to persuade them to take the
risk of investing, especially in the longer term.

(d)

Liquidity preference of investors and the demand for borrowing
Higher interest rates have to be offered to persuade savers to invest their surplus money. When
the demand to borrow increases, interest rates will rise.

(e)

Balance of payments
When a country has a continuing deficit on the current account of its balance of payments, and the
authorities are unwilling to allow the exchange rate to depreciate by more than a certain amount,
interest rates may have to be raised to attract capital into the country. The country can then
finance the deficit by borrowing from abroad.

(f)

Monetary policy
As explained above, the monetary policy of a government may be to try to control the rate of
inflation through management of short-term interest rates. This is done by the central bank, which
can control very short-term interest rates through the rates at which it lends to banks. However,
although the central bank can act to change just short-term interest rates, it may expect that
increases or reductions in short-term rates will eventually work through to increases or reductions
in longer-term interest rates.

3.3 Interest rate risk management
Exam focus
point
FAST FORWARD

You may find it useful to read the article titled 'Hedging techniques for interest rate risk' on the ACCA
website.
Interest rate risk can be managed using internal hedging in the form of asset and liability management,
matching and smoothing or using external hedging instruments, such as forward rate agreements and
interest rate derivatives.

3.4 Asset and liability management
Fixed interest rates for payments or earnings may have different maturity time scales. Asset and liability
management aims to achieve similar durations for payments and earnings. For example, say a business
has a 10 year mortgage on a building at a fixed rate of interest of 5% per year. It rents out the building for
six years at a rate of 7% per year. This is fine for six years but then if rental yields fall to 4% per year, the
business will start to lose money. A safer option would have been to match the loan period to the rental
period.

3.5 Matching and smoothing
Matching and smoothing are two methods of internal hedging used to manage interest rate risk.

Key term

Matching is where liabilities and assets with a common interest rate are matched.
For example, subsidiary A of a company might be investing in the money markets at LIBOR and subsidiary
B is borrowing through the same market at LIBOR. If LIBOR increases, subsidiary A's borrowing cost
increases and subsidiary B's returns increase. The interest rates on the assets and liabilities are therefore
matched.
This method is most widely used by financial institutions, such as banks, who find it easier to match the
magnitudes and characteristics of their assets and liabilities than commercial or industrial companies.

414

20: Interest rate risk

Part G Risk management
w


Key term

Smoothing is where a company keeps a balance between its fixed rate and floating rate borrowing. Some
loans or deposits have fixed rates of interest and some have variable rates.
A rise in interest rates will make the variable rate loan more expensive but this will be compensated for by
the less expensive fixed rate loan. However, the company may incur increased transaction and
arrangement costs.
Major companies with large amounts of borrowing may try to maintain a balance between fixed rate and
floating rate debt.

3.6 Forward rate agreements (FRAs)
FAST FORWARD

6/15, Sep/Dec 15

Forward rate agreements hedge risk by fixing the interest rate on future short-term borrowing.
A forward rate agreement (FRA) for interest rates is similar in many respects to a forward exchange
contract for currencies.


FRAs are arranged with a bank as an over the counter transaction.



An FRA is a binding contract that fixes an interest rate for short-term lending/investing or
short-term borrowing, for an interest rate period that begins at a future date.

In other words, an FRA fixes an interest rate now for a future short-term lending/investing/borrowing
transaction.
However, an FRA is not an agreement to lend or borrow. It is an agreement that fixes an interest rate on a
notional amount of principal.
A company can enter into a FRA with a bank that fixes the rate of interest for short-term borrowing from
a certain time in the future. If the actual interest rate at that date proves to be higher than the rate in the
FRA, the bank pays the company the difference. If the actual interest rate is lower than the FRA rate, the
company pays the bank the difference. The FRA does not need to be with the same bank as the loan, as
the FRA is a hedging method independent of any loan agreement.
One limitation of FRAs is that they are usually only available on large loans. They are also likely to be
difficult to obtain for periods of over one year.
An advantage of FRAs is that, for the period of the FRA at least, they protect the borrower from adverse
market interest rate movements to levels above the rate negotiated for the FRA. With a normal variable
rate loan (for example linked to a bank's base rate or to LIBOR) the borrower is exposed to the risk of
such adverse market movements. On the other hand, the borrower will similarly not benefit from the
effects of favourable market interest rate movements.
The interest rates for which banks arrange FRAs will reflect their current expectations of interest rate
movements. If it is expected that interest rates are going to rise during the term for which the FRA is being
negotiated, the bank is likely to seek a higher FRA rate than the spot rate of interest which is current at the
time of negotiating the FRA.

3.6.1 FRA terminology
The terminology is as follows.
(a)

5.75 – 5.70 means that you can fix a borrowing rate at 5.75% (and a deposit rate at 5.70%). The
interest rate in the FRA will be compared with a reference rate or benchmark rate of interest, which
is specified by the FRA agreement. The reference rate may be, for example, the three-month LIBOR
rate or the six-month LIBOR rate.

(b)

A '3 – 6' forward rate agreement is an agreement that fixes an interest rate for a period starting in
three months' time and lasting for three months to the end of month six. Similarly, a '3 – 12' FRA
fixes the interest rate for a nine-month period starting in three months' time.

(c)

A basis point is 0.01%.

3.6.2 Example: Forward rate agreement
Lynn plc is a UK listed company. It is 30 June. Lynn will need a £10m six-month fixed rate loan from
1 October. Lynn wants to hedge its exposure to the risk of a rise in the six-month interest rate between the
end of June and 1 October, using an FRA. The relevant FRA rate is 6% on 30 June and the reference rate
for the FRA is the six-month LIBOR rate. The current six-month FRA rate is 6.25%.
(a)

State what FRA is required.

(b)

What is the result of the FRA and the effective loan rate if the spot six-month LIBOR rate (the
benchmark or reference rate for the FRA) is:
(i)
(ii)

5%
9%

Solution
(a)

The FRA required is '3 – 9'. It is for a period beginning after three months and lasting for six
months. The FRA is for Lynn to borrow a notional sum of £10m for six months at a fixed rate of
6%, starting on 1 October.
Lynn has fixed the effective borrowing rate with the FRA, even though it may not be borrowing the
£10m from the bank that has arranged the FRA.

(b)

(i)

If the six-month LIBOR rate on 1 October is 5%, the LIBOR rate will have fallen since 30 June.
The FRA is a binding contract, so Lynn must borrow the notional sum of £10m for
six months at 6%. In practice, there is no actual lending. Instead, Lynn makes a payment for
the difference between interest for six months at the FRA rate of 6% and the spot rate of 5%.
The payment is £10m

(6% – 5%)

6

/12 = £50,000.

Let's suppose that Lynn is able to borrow for 6 months at the LIBOR rate. It will borrow
£10m on 1 October for six months at an interest rate of 5%. Taking the cost of the actual
loan interest with the cost of the FRA payment, the effective cost of borrowing for the
six months is an annual rate of 6%. This is the rate in the FRA.

(ii)

If the six-month LIBOR rate on 1 October is 9%, the LIBOR rate will have fallen since
6
30 June. To settle the FRA contract, the bank must pay Lynn: £10m (9% – 6%) /12 =
£150,000.
Let's suppose again that Lynn is able to borrow for six months at the LIBOR rate. It will
borrow £10m on 1 October for six months at an interest rate of 9%. Taking the cost of the
actual loan interest with the revenue from the FRA contract, the effective cost of borrowing
for the six months is an annual rate of 6%. This is the rate in the FRA.

Q1(b). This 5-mark question asked for an explanation of the nature of a forward rate agreement (FRA) and
how it can be used to manage interest rate risk. Many students thought that a FRA was a forward

4 Interest rate derivatives
FAST FORWARD

6/15, Mar/June 16, 9/16, 12/16

Interest rate derivatives can be used to hedge against the risk of interest rate changes. They include
interest rate futures, interest rate options and interest rate swaps.

4.1 Interest rate futures
Interest rate futures offer a means of hedging against the risk of interest rate movements. Such contracts
are effectively a gamble on whether interest rates will rise or fall. Like other futures contracts, interest rate
futures offer a way in which speculators can 'bet' on market movements just as they offer others who are
more risk averse a way of hedging risks.
Interest rate futures are similar in effect to FRAs, except that the terms, amounts and periods are
standardised. For example, a company can contract to buy (or sell) £100,000 of a notional 30-year
Treasury bond bearing an 8% coupon in, say, six months' time, at an agreed price. The basic principles
behind such a decision are:
(a)

The futures price is likely to vary with changes in interest rates, and this acts as a hedge against
adverse interest rate movements.

(b)

The outlay to buy futures is much less than for buying the financial instrument itself, and so a
company can hedge large exposures of cash with a relatively small initial employment of cash.

4.1.1 Nature of interest rate futures contracts
The standardised nature of interest rate futures is a limitation on their use by the corporate treasurer as a
means of hedging, because they cannot always be matched with specific interest rate exposures. Futures
contracts are frequently used by banks and other financial institutions as a means of hedging their
portfolios: such institutions are often not concerned with achieving an exact match with their underlying
exposure.

4.1.2 Entitlement with contracts
With interest rate futures what we buy is the entitlement to interest receipts and what we sell is the
promise to make interest payments. So when a lender buys one three-month sterling contract (another
way of putting this is that the lender enters into a contract to buy) they have the right to receive interest for
three months in sterling. When a borrower sells a three-month sterling contract (again, another way of
putting this is that the lender enters into a contract to sell) they incur an obligation to make interest
payments for three months.
(a)

Selling a future creates the obligation to borrow money and the obligation to pay interest.
Borrowers will wish to hedge against an interest rate rise by selling futures now and buying
futures on the day that the interest rate is fixed.

(b)

Buying a future creates the obligation to deposit money and the right to receive interest. Lenders
will wish to hedge against the possibility of falling interest rates by buying futures now and selling
futures on the date that the actual lending starts.

against an interest rate risk increase will buy interest rate futures now and sell them at a future date'. This
is incorrect because borrowers sell futures now and buy them at a later date. You need to know details like
this to be able to answer the MCQs in Section A of the exam. You also need to read the questions carefully
so as not to miss details like this.

4.1.3 Other factors to consider
(a)

Short-term interest rate futures contracts normally represent interest receivable or payable on
notional lending or borrowing for a three-month period beginning on a standard future date. The
contract size depends on the currency in which the lending or borrowing takes place. For example,
the three-month sterling interest rate futures March contract represents the interest on notional
lending or borrowing of £500,000 for three months, starting at the end of March. £500,000 is the
contract size.

(b)

As with all futures, a whole number of contracts must be dealt with. Note that the notional period
of lending or borrowing starts when the contract expires, at the end of March.

(c)

On LIFFE (London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange), futures contracts are
available with maturity dates at the end of March, June, September and December. The
three-month eurodollar interest rate futures contract is for notional lending or borrowing in US
dollars. The contract size is $1m.

4.2 Interest rate options
FAST FORWARD

Key term

Interest rate options allow an organisation to limit its exposure to adverse interest rate movements, while
allowing it to take advantage of favourable interest rate movements.
An interest rate option grants the buyer of it the right, but not the obligation, to deal at an agreed interest
rate (strike rate) at a future maturity date (the expiry date for the option).
On the date of expiry of the option, the buyer must decide whether or not to exercise the right.
Options are like insurance policies. A premium is paid and then the option can be exercised or ignored.
Clearly, a buyer of an option to borrow will not wish to exercise it if the market interest rate is now
below that specified in the option agreement. Conversely, an option to lend will not be worth exercising if
market rates have risen above the rate specified in the option by the time the option has expired.
Tailor-made 'over the counter' interest rate options can be purchased from major banks, with specific
values, periods of maturity, denominated currencies and rates of agreed interest. The cost of the option is
the 'premium'. Interest rate options offer more flexibility and are more expensive than FRAs.
Note that an option to sell is known as a put option and an option to buy is known as a call option.

4.3 Interest rate caps, collars and floors
FAST FORWARD

Caps set a ceiling to the interest rate; a floor sets a lower limit. A collar is the simultaneous purchase of a
cap and sale of floor.
Various cap and collar agreements are possible.

Key terms

418

(a)

An interest rate cap is an option which sets an interest rate ceiling.

(b)

A floor is an option which sets a lower limit to interest rates.

(c)

Using a 'collar' arrangement, the borrower can buy an interest rate cap and at the same time sell
an interest rate floor. This limits the cost for the company, as it receives a premium for the option
it's sold.

20: Interest rate risk

Part G Risk management
w


The cost of a collar is lower than for buying an option alone. However, the borrowing company forgoes the
benefit of movements in interest rates below the floor limit in exchange for this cost reduction and an
investing company forgoes the benefit of movements in interest rates above the cap level. A zero cost
collar can even be negotiated sometimes, if the premium paid for buying the cap equals the premium
received for selling the floor.

4.4 Interest rate swaps
FAST FORWARD

Interest rate swaps are where two parties agree to exchange interest rate payments.
Interest rate swaps can act as a means of switching from paying one type of interest to another, raising
less expensive loans and securing better deposit rates.
A fixed to floating rate currency swap is a combination of a currency and interest rate swap.

Key term

Interest rate swap is an agreement whereby the parties to the agreement exchange interest rate
commitments.

4.4.1 Swap procedures
Interest rate swaps involve two parties agreeing to exchange interest payments with each other over an
agreed period. In practice, however, the major players in the swaps market are banks and many other
types of institution can become involved, for example national and local governments and international
institutions.
In the simplest form of interest rate swap, party A agrees to pay the interest on party B's loan, while party
B reciprocates by paying the interest on A's loan. If the swap is to make sense, the two parties must swap
interest which has different characteristics. Assuming that the interest swapped is in the same currency,
the most common motivation for the swap is to switch from paying floating rate interest to fixed interest
or vice versa. This type of swap is known as a 'plain vanilla' or generic swap.

4.4.2 Why bother to swap?
Obvious questions to ask are:



Why do the companies bother swapping interest payments with each other?
Why don't they just terminate their original loan and take out a new one?

The answer is that transaction costs may be too high. Terminating an original loan early may involve a
significant termination fee and taking out a new loan will involve issue costs. Arranging a swap can be
significantly cheaper, even if a banker is used as an intermediary. Because the banker is simply acting as
an agent on the swap arrangement and has to bear no default risk, the arrangement fee can be kept low.

Chapter Roundup


The interest rates on financial assets are influenced by the risk of the assets, the duration of the lending,
and the size of the loan.
There is a trade-off between risk and return. Investors in riskier assets expect to be compensated for the
risk.



Interest rate risk relates to the sensitivity of profit and cash flows to changes in interest rates.
Interest rate risk is faced by companies with floating and fixed rate debt. It can arise from gap exposure
and basis risk.



The causes of interest rate fluctuations include the structure of interest rates and yield curves and
changing economic factors.



Interest rate risk can be managed using internal hedging in the form of asset and liability management,
matching and smoothing or using external hedging instruments, such as forward rate agreements and
interest rate derivatives.



Forward rate agreements hedge risk by fixing the interest rate on future short-term borrowing.



Interest rate derivatives can be used to hedge against the risk of interest rate changes. They include
interest rate futures, interest rate options and interest rate swaps.



Interest rate options allow an organisation to limit its exposure to adverse interest rate movements, while
allowing it to take advantage of favourable interest rate movements.



Caps set a ceiling to the interest rate; a floor sets a lower limit. A collar is the simultaneous purchase of a
cap and sale of floor.



Interest rate swaps are where two parties agree to exchange interest rate payments.
Interest rate swaps can act as a means of switching from paying one type of interest to another, raising
less expensive loans and securing better deposit rates.
A fixed to floating rate currency swap is a combination of a currency and interest rate swap.

These profit forecasts were viewed with disappointment by the directors and there was a general feeling
that the new product should not be launched. The Chief Executive pointed out that the product achieved
profits in only two years of its four-year life and that over the four-year period as a whole, a net loss was
expected. However, before a meeting that had been arranged to decide formally the future of the product,
the following additional information became available:
(i)

The new product will require the use of an existing machine. This has a written down value of
$80,000 but could be sold for $70,000 immediately if the new product is not launched. If the
product is launched, it will be sold at the end of the four-year period for $10,000.

(ii)

Additional working capital of $20,000 will be required immediately and will be needed over the
four-year period. It will be released at the end of the period.

(iii)

The fixed overheads include a figure of $15,000 per year for depreciation of the machine and
$5,000 per year for the re-allocation of existing overheads of the business.

The company has a cost of capital of 10%.
Ignore taxation.

39 mins

Auriga (Healthcare) has invested $220,000 over the past two years in the development of a personal
stress-monitoring device (PSMD). The device is designed for busy individuals wishing to check their
stress levels. Market research that was commissioned earlier in the year at a cost of $45,000 suggests
that the price for the PSMD should be $22 per unit and that the expected product life cycle of the device is
four years.
In order to produce the device, the business must purchase immediately specialist machinery and
equipment at a cost of $300,000. This machinery and equipment has an expected life of four years and will
have no residual value at the end of this period. The machinery and equipment can produce a maximum of
15,000 PSMDs per year over four years. To ensure that the maximum output is achieved, the business will
spend $50,000 a year in advertising the device over the next four years.

Notes
(1)

The materials figure above includes a charge of $2 for a polymer that is currently in stock and can
be used for this project. Each PSMD requires 200 grams of the polymer and the charge is based on
the original cost of $1 per 100 grams for the polymer. It is a material that is currently used in other
areas of the business and the cost of replacing the polymer is $1.50 per 100 grams. The polymer
could easily be sold at a price of $1.25 per 100 grams.

(2)

The labour costs relate to payments made to employees that will be directly involved in producing
the PSMD. These employees have no work at present and, if the PSMD is not produced, they will
be made redundant immediately at a cost of $230,000. If, however, the PSMD is produced, the
employees are likely to be found other work at the end of the four-year period and so no
redundancy costs will be incurred.

(3)

The figure includes a depreciation charge for the new machinery and equipment. The policy of the
business is to depreciate non-current assets in equal instalments over their expected life. All other
overheads included in the above figure are incurred in production of the new device.

Auriga uses a cost of capital of 10% to assess projects.

Apportionment of general building occupancy $168,000
Other overheads $80,000, of which $60,000 represent additional cash expenditures (including rent of
machinery)
To manufacture the product, a product manager will have to be recruited at an annual gross cost of
$34,000, and one assistant manager, whose current annual salary is $30,000, will be transferred from
another department, where they will be replaced by a new appointee at a cost of $27,000 a year.
The necessary machinery will be rented. It will be installed in the company's factory. This will take up
space that would otherwise be rented to another local company for $135,000 a year. This rent (for the
factory space) is not subject to any uncertainty, as a binding four-year lease would be created.
60,000 kg of material X are already in inventory, at a purchase value of $98,400. They have no use other
than the manufacture of the new product. Their disposal value is $50,000.

17 DF

39 mins

DF is a manufacturer of sports equipment. All of the shares of DF are held by the Wong family.
The company has recently won a major 3-year contract to supply FF with a range of sports equipment. FF
is a large company with over 100 sports shops. The contract may be renewed after 3 years.
The new contract is expected to double DF's existing total annual sales, but demand from FF will vary
considerably from month to month.
The contract will, however, mean a significant additional investment in both non-current and current
assets. A loan from the bank is to be used to finance the additional non-current assets, as the Wong family
is currently unable to supply any further share capital. Also, the Wong family does not wish to raise new
capital by issuing shares to non-family members.
The financing of the additional current assets is yet to be decided. In particular, the contract with FF will
require orders to be delivered within two days. This delivery period gives DF insufficient time to manufacture
items, thus significant inventories need to be held at all times. Also, FF requires 90 days' credit from its
suppliers. This will result in a significant additional investment in accounts receivable by DF.
If the company borrows from the bank to finance current assets, either using a loan or an overdraft, it
expects to be charged annual interest at 12%. Consequently, DF is considering alternative methods of
financing current assets. These include debt factoring, invoice discounting and offering a 3% cash
discount to FF for settlement within 10 days rather than the normal 90 days.
Required

(a)

Calculate the annual equivalent rate of interest implicit in offering a 3% discount to FF for
settlement of debts within 10 days rather than 90 days.
Briefly explain the factors, other than the rate of interest, that DF would need to consider before
deciding on whether to offer a cash discount.

Katash proposes to finance the $900m investment with a combination of debt and equity as follows:


$390m in debt paying interest at 9.5% per annum, secured on the new premises and repayable in
20X8.



$510m in equity via a rights issue. A discount of 15% on the current share price is likely.

A marginally positive NPV of the proposed investment has been calculated using a discount rate of 15%.
This is the entity's cost of equity plus a small premium, a rate judged to reflect the risk of this venture. The
Chief Executive of Katash thinks this is too marginal and is doubtful whether the investment should go
ahead. However, there is some disagreement among the Directors about how this project was evaluated,
in particular about the discount rate that has been used.
Director A:

Suggests the entity's current WACC is more appropriate.

Director B:

Suggests calculating a discount rate using data from Chlopop, a quoted entity, the main
competitor in the new business area. Relevant data for this entity is as follows:




Shares in issue: 600 million currently quoted at 560 cents each
Debt outstanding: $525m variable rate bank loan
Equity beta: 1.6

Other relevant information


The risk-free rate is estimated at 5% per annum and the return on the market 12% per annum.
These rates are not expected to change in the foreseeable future.



Katash pays corporate tax at 30% and this rate is not expected to change in the foreseeable future.



Issue costs should be ignored.

Section A answers
1

Statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false.
Management accounts are used as a future planning tool (not financial accounts).

2

Correct answer – Financial management decisions include dividend decisions.
Incorrect answers:
1st option – most financial accounting information is of a monetary nature.
2nd option – management accounts act as a future planning tool.
4th option – financial management is the management of finance.

3

Correct answer – Local community
Incorrect answers:
The other options are all connected stakeholders because they have a financial connection to the
company.

4

Both statements are true.
If a government spends more, for example, on public services such as hospitals without raising
more money in taxation, it will increase expenditure in the economy and raise demand.
A government can reduce demand in the economy by raising taxes or reducing its expenditure.

5

Statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false.
Aggregate demand is the total amount of goods and services demanded in the economy at a given
overall price level and in a given time period. As it increases, more jobs are created and growth
occurs.
Statement 2 is false. High interest rates appear to deter companies from investing.

6

Both statements are true.
Raising taxes or reducing government spending are methods that the government uses to reduce
demand in the economy.
'Fiscal policy' is a term for the ways in which a government will attempt to manage the economy
through taxation, spending, and borrowing.

7

Correct answer – Certificates of deposits and money market deposits
These are interest-bearing instruments (not derivatives).

8

Correct answer – Shareholder
A shareholder is not a financial intermediary as they do not act as a middleman connecting
borrowers and savers. Commercial banks, pension funds and finance houses are all financial
intermediaries.

9

Correct answers – Swap and Forward contract
Derivatives include forwards, swaps, futures and options. Treasury bills are discount instruments.
Certificates of deposit are interest-bearing instruments.

10

Correct answer – Increasing credit given to customers.
Increasing credit given to customers will increase the level of receivables and this will lengthen the
working capital cycle.

11

Statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false.
Symptoms of overtrading include a rapid increase in sales revenue andan increase (not decrease)
in the volume of current assets.

w

Practice answer bank

459

12

Both statements are true.
If there are excessive inventories, receivables and cash and few payables, there will be an over
investment by the company in current assets. A conservative approach results in high levels of
cash tied up in excessive inventories and receivables and harms profits.

= $204,124 = $204,000 to the nearest $'000
15

Correct answer – future costs & incremental costs.
A decision is about the future, therefore relevant costs are future costs that change as a result of a
decision. Costs that change as the result of a decision are known as incremental costs.
Incorrect answers:
2nd option – unavoidable costs are not affected by decisions and are therefore not 'relevant'.
4th option – sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred in the past and are therefore not
relevant to a future decision.

16

Correct answers:
Relevant

Not-relevant

1. Depreciation of the machine

X

2. Past research into different types of machine

X

3. Annual maintenance costs for the machine

X

Depreciation is not a cash flow and so is not relevant.
Past research into different types of machine is a sunk cost and therefore not relevant.
Annual maintenance costs will be a future incremental cash flow and so are relevant.

17

Correct answer – none of these.
Statement 1 is not true. Payback tends to favour short-term projects and therefore minimises
financial and business risk.
Statement 2 is untrue. It is simple to understand.
Statement 3 is not true because payback helps to identify those projects which generate additional
cash for investment quickly.

Correct answers: It reduces uncertainty and It may lead to excessive investment in short-term
projects
Because payback favours short-term projects, it tends to minimise the uncertainty associated with
projects. If payback is used, it may lead to excessive investment in short-term projects as it will
favour those that payback the initial investment quickly
Incorrect answers:
It is a measure used by external analysts – ROCE (not payback) is used by analysts
It looks at the entire project life – Payback only looks at the period up to the payback and ignores
the cash flows after payback.

ROCE can be used to compare two or more investment options. Unlike payback, ROCE takes no
account of the length of the project. Both payback and ROCE ignore the time value of money. ROCE
is based on accounting profits and not cash flows. Accounting profits are subject to a number of
different accounting treatments.

Correct answer: equity beta of Florrie reflects both systematic and financial risk.
The cost of debt is above the risk free rate, so the debt beta is not zero.
The equity beta of 0.98 means that systematic risk is lower (not higher) than for the market on
average.
It is assumed that unsystematic risk (not systematic risk) can be diversified away.

10

Correct answers: If WACC is underestimated then projects may be accepted that do not deliver a
positive NPV. WACC assumes new investments have the same risk as current ones.
Market values (rather than book values) should be used. WACC assumes the long term gearing will
not change.

This represents a growth of $4,711,700/$4,356,000 × 100% = 8.17%
Equity market value using the dividend growth model is therefore:

Both statements are false.

Correct answer: 1, 2 and 3.
The net asset basis can be used as a floor value for a business that is up for sale. Shareholders will
be reluctant to sell for less than the net asset value.
A share might be valued using an earnings basis. This valuation might be higher or lower than the
net asset value per share. If the earnings basis is higher and the company went into liquidation, the
investor could not expect to receive the full value of their shares when the underlying assets were
realised. The asset backing thus provides a measure of the possible loss if the company fails to
make the expected earnings or dividend payments.
The net asset basis can also be used as a measure of comparison in a scheme of merger. For
example if two companies have different asset backings then one might consider that their shares'
value should reflect this.

Correct answer: 2 only.
Robin Co should enter into a forward contract to sell €800,000 in six months. This would reduce
the risk of the euro value dropping relative to the dollar before the €800,000 is received.
Statement 1 is incorrect. Robin Co could use a money market hedge but €800,000 would have to
be borrowed, then converted into dollars and then placed on deposit.
Statement 3 is incorrect. An interest rate swap, swaps one type of interest payment (such as fixed
interest) for another (such as floating rate interest). Therefore it would not be suitable.

Incorrect answers:

Section C style answers
1 Gustaffson
Top tips. Part (a) should be fairly straightforward. Part (b) should be approached by using your
calculations to determine whether overtrading exists rather than just calculating random ratios. This
means examining the short-term ratios in company finance, as well as sales growth, profit margins,
liquidity ratios and working capital ratios. Do not be surprised however if not all the ratios show the same
results; here the company is keeping up its payment schedule to accounts payable despite its other
problems.
(b) concludes by highlighting the most important indicators of overtrading. It is important to do this in an
answer where you have given a lot of detail, as you need to pick out where the greatest threats to the
business lie. In this question the threats highlighted at the end of part (b) will be those for which remedies
are identified in (c).
(a)

Overtrading
'Overtrading' commonly occurs when a company is expanding rapidly, and the term refers to the
situation where the company becomes over-reliant on short-term finance to support its growing
operations. This is risky because short-term finance may be withdrawn relatively quickly if
accounts payable lose confidence in the business, or if there is a general tightening of credit in the
economy, and this may result in a liquidity crisis and even bankruptcy, even though the firm is
profitable. The fundamental solution to overtrading is to replace short term finance with longer
term finance such as term loans or equity funds.

(b)

(i)

The company has become significantly more reliant on short term liabilities to finance its
operations as shown by the following analysis:
20X9
$'000
21,350

Total assets
Short-term liabilities
Long-term funds (equity and debt)

40.7%
59.3%

5,000
9,900
14,900

33.6%
66.4%

Overtrading
A major reason for this is classic overtrading: sales increased by 50% in one year, but the
operating profit margin fell from 9,000/20,000 = 45% in 20X8 to 10,000/30,000 = 33% in
20X9.
Refinancing
However, the effect is compounded by the repayment of $2.3m (66%) of the 8% loan notes
and replacement with a $2m bank overdraft and increased trade creditor finance. Although
this may be because the interest rate on the overdraft is cheaper than on the loan notes, it is
generally not advisable in the context of the risk of short term debt.
However, if it is felt that the current sales volume is abnormal and that, when the Polly
Playtime doll reaches the end of its product life cycle, sales will stabilise at a lower level, the
use of shorter term debt is justified.
Liquidity ratios
As a result of overtrading, the company's current ratio has deteriorated from 13,500/5000 =
2.7 in 20X8 to 19,850/8700 = 2.28 in 20X9. The quick assets ratio (or 'acid test') has
deteriorated from 10,500/5,000 = 2.1 to 12,500/8,700 = 1.44. However these figures are
acceptable and only if they continue to deteriorate is there likely to be a liquidity problem. In
the 20X9 accounts the company continues to have a healthy bank balance, although this
has been achieved partly by halting dividend growth.

Investment in non-current assets
The company has not maintained an investment in non-current assets to match its sales
growth. Sales/non-current assets has increased from 20,000/1,400 = 14.3 times to
30,000/1,500 = 20 times. This may be putting the quality of production at risk, but may be
justified, however, if sales are expected to decline when the doll loses popularity.
Working capital ratios
An investigation of working capital ratios shows that:
(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

Inventory turnover has decreased from 11,000/3,000 = 3.67 times to 20,000/7,350
= 2.72 times. This indicates that there has been a large investment in inventory. The
question of whether this is justified again depends on expected future sales, but the
strategy appears to be the opposite of that adopted for non-current assets.
The average accounts receivable payment period has increased from
6,000/20,000 365 = 110 days to 10,000/30,000 365 = 122 days, indicating a lack
of credit control. This has contributed to a weakening of the cash position. There
appears to be no evidence of prompt payment discounts to accounts receivable.
The payment period to accounts payable (roughly estimated) has decreased from
2,500/11,000 365 = 83 days to 4,200/20,000 365 = 77 days. This result is
unexpected, indicating that there has been no increase in delaying payment to
accounts payable over the year. Suppliers are being paid in a significantly shorter
period than the period of credit taken by customers.
The sales/net working capital ratio has increased from 20,000/8,500 = 2.35 times to
30,000/11,150 = 2.69 times. This indicates that working capital has not increased in
line with sales and this may indicate future liquidity problems.

Conclusion
In summary, the main problem facing Gustaffson is its increasing overdependence on short
term finance, caused in the main by:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(ii)

A major investment in inventory to satisfy a rapid increase in sales volumes
Deteriorating profit margins
Poor credit control of accounts receivable
Repayment of bond capital

Future sales
Possible solutions to the above problems depend on future sales and product projections.
If the rapid increase in sales has been a one-product phenomenon, there is little point in
over-capitalising by borrowing long term and investing in a major expansion of non-current
assets. If, however, sales of this and future products are expected to continue increasing,
and further investment is needed, the company's growth should be underpinned by an
injection of equity capital and an issue of longer term debt.
Better working capital management
Regardless of the above, various working capital strategies could be improved. Credit
customers should be encouraged to pay more promptly. This is best done by instituting
proper credit control procedures. Longer credit periods could probably be negotiated with
accounts payable and quantity discounts should be investigated.

2 H Finance
Top tips. When analysing a working capital policy it is sensible to lay out the costs and benefits clearly and
to state any assumptions that you have made.
To answer (b) well you needed to bring out benefits in different areas (factoring as a source of finance,
use of factors as means of improving working capital management and decreasing administration time
and costs.) As far as the effect on the accounts is concerned, the gearing point is significant but note the
uncertain effect on return on capital employed.
(a)

Assuming that the historical data presented is a reasonable guide to what will happen in the future,
we can use some approximate calculations to assess whether the factoring of the debts would be
worthwhile as follows. The 20Y0 figures are assumed below to be typical.

(2) Administration costs
(3) Lost profits

(2) Saved administration costs
(3) Possible savings in bad debts
(1) Saved finance costs
Total

$000s
80
615
3,909
4,604

Cost exceeds benefit so using the factor would not be worthwhile.
(1)

Cost of finance
The cost of the finance provided by the factor is 5% of sales, since 80% and then a further
15% is remitted by the factor. If sales are 10% lower due to the aggressive collection
procedures, then this is 0.05 98,714 0.9 = 4,442.
Assuming that 80% of receivables will be factored, and that these will be lower in the future
because of the lost sales of 0.22 98,714 0.9 = 19,545, this will save the finance cost
associated with these receivables of 19,545 0.2 = 3,909.
Note: If D Co was using an overdraft there would also be an interest saving on the reduction
in the overdraft from using the reduced receivables to reduce the overdraft.

(2)

Administration costs
In addition, there would be administration costs of 0.5% 98.7m 0.9 = 444. This
amounts to considerably more than the amount of $80,000 saved in D's own administration
costs.

(3)

Bad debts
There may be some saving through a reduction in bad debts, which in 20Y0 amounted to
615 which is 0.6% of revenue. However there is against this a loss of contribution
amounting to 18% 10% 98,714 = 1,777 as a result of the factor's aggressive collection
procedures.

(b)

Aspects of factoring
The three main aspects of factoring are as follows.
(i)

Administration of the client's invoicing, sales accounting and debt collection service.

(ii)

Credit protection for the client's debts, whereby the factor takes over the risk of loss from
bad debts and so 'insures' the client against such losses. This service is also referred to as
'debt underwriting' or the 'purchase of a client's debts'. The factor usually purchases these
debts 'without recourse' to the client, which means that in the event that the client's
accounts receivable are unable to pay what they owe, the factor will not ask for his money
back from the client.

(iii)

Making payments to the client in advance of collecting the debts. This might be referred to
as 'factor finance' because the factor is providing cash to the client against outstanding debts.

Benefits of factoring
The benefits of factoring for a business customer include the following.
(i)

The business can pay its suppliers promptly, and so can take advantage of any early
payment discounts that are available.

(ii)

Optimum inventory levels can be maintained, because the business will have enough cash
to pay for the inventories it needs.

(iii)

Growth can be financed through sales rather than by injecting fresh external capital.

(iv)

The business gets finance linked to its volume of sales. In contrast, overdraft limits tend to
be determined by historical statements of financial position.

(v)

The managers of the business do not have to spend their time on the problems of slowpaying accounts receivable.

(vi)

The business does not incur the costs of running its own sales ledger department.

Effect on accounts
Factoring of sales invoicing leads to a reduction of accounts receivable and therefore of assets
employed in the business, accompanied by a reduction in profit as a result of the costs involved.
Part of these 'costs' are generally reflected in the fact that less than 100% of the debt is paid to the
company by the factor. The effect on the return on capital employed will depend upon the cost of
factoring and the level of profits without factoring relative to assets employed.
Since they reduce assets, the funds advanced by the factor do not show up as borrowings in the
statement of financial position. The apparent gearing will therefore improve. Factoring is attractive to
some companies as a method of avoiding borrowing limits or covenants being breached. It
provides a means of financing accounts receivable, which are otherwise unsuitable for secured
lending because of their volatility.
Disadvantages of factoring
The main disadvantage of factoring is that it is a relatively expensive form of finance compared to
loan finance. Some businesses will also find it undesirable for customer relations if the
administration of debt collection is passed to a third party.

3 Victory
Top tips. Always note how long it will take to deliver orders as this is an important detail, even though it
isn't brought into the economic order quantity calculation.
In (a)(iii) and (b)(i) you need to bring purchasing costs in as they will be affected by the discount.
For questions like (b)(ii) focus on what might differ in the real world from what is assumed to happen for
the purposes of the calculation, and think about non-financial factors.
Remember for questions such as (c) that just-in-time is a philosophy that impacts upon the whole
production process, not just delivery of inventory. That said, relationships with suppliers are critical and
do need to be stressed.

Q = 883.2 units
The economic order quantity is therefore 883 units (to the nearest unit).

To determine whether it is financially viable to change supplier we must calculate the total
annual cost of ordering from this supplier and to compare this with the existing annual cost.

(ii)

Limitations of the calculations include the following:
(1)
(2)
(3)

Demand is assumed to be the same throughout the year. In practice, there are likely
to be variations.
It is assumed that the lead-time is constant and that the suppliers are both
completely dependable.
It is assumed that purchase costs are constant. In practice it is necessary to allow
for the effects of differing discount and credit policies.

Non-financial factors to be considered include:
(1)

Quality must be consistent and reliable from both suppliers.

(2)

Packaging differences must be acceptable, and the product from both suppliers
must be equally attractive to consumers.
Flexibility. Both suppliers must be able to respond quickly and efficiently to
variations in the level of demand.
Environmental effects. Victory must ensure that the suppliers' production facilities
meet any agreed environmental standards that the company requires.

(3)
(4)
(c)

Just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing involves obtaining goods from suppliers at the latest possible
time (ie when they are needed on the production line), thereby avoiding the need to carry any
materials or components inventory. Reduced inventory levels mean that a lower level of
investment in working capital will be required. In certain environments where the cost of a stockout is high, JIT is inappropriate, eg in a hospital, the cost of a stock-out for certain items could be
fatal.

The main features of a JIT system include the following:

474

(i)

Deliveries will be small and frequent, rather than in bulk. Production runs will also be
shorter.

(ii)

Supplier relationships must be close, since high demands will be placed on suppliers to
deliver on time and with 100% quality.

(iii)

Unit purchasing prices may need to be higher than in a conventional system to
compensate suppliers for their need to hold higher inventories and to meet more rigorous
quality and delivery requirements. However, savings in production costs and reductions in
working capital should offset these costs.

(iv)

Improved labour productivity should result from a smoother flow of materials through the
process.

(v)

Production process improvements may be required for a JIT system to function to full
effectiveness. In particular set-up time for machinery may have to be reduced, workforce
teams reorganised, and movement of materials within the production process minimised.

Top tips. The key point to emphasise is that holding too much working capital is expensive whereas
holding too little can result in system breakdown. However, modern manufacturing techniques and
re-engineering of business processes can help achieve the best of both worlds: low working capital and
efficient production and sales systems.

In (b) you need to show the effects on assets and liabilities, sales and profits, and current ratios and return
on assets to score maximum marks. In (c) a couple of marks are available specifically for a

Working capital policy

Conservative working capital policy
A conservative policy, such as we adopt at present, aims to reduce the risk of system breakdown
by holding high levels of working capital. Thus customers are allowed generous payment terms to
stimulate demand, inventory of finished goods is high to ensure availability for customers, and raw
materials and work in progress are high to minimise the risk of running out of inventory and
consequent downtime in the manufacturing process. Suppliers are paid promptly to ensure their
goodwill, again to minimise the chance of stock-outs.
Aggressive working capital policy
An aggressive working capital investment policy aims to reduce this financing cost and increase
profitability by cutting inventory, speeding up collections from customers, and delaying
payments to suppliers. The potential disadvantage of this policy is an increase in the chances of
system breakdown through running out of inventory or loss of goodwill with customers and
suppliers. However, modern manufacturing techniques encourage inventory and work in progress
reductions through just–in–time policies, flexible production facilities and improved quality
management. Improved customer satisfaction through quality and effective response to customer
demand can also enable the shortening of credit periods. Our modern production facility gives the
company the potential to implement radical new management techniques, including those
mentioned above, and to move along the working capital policy spectrum towards a more
aggressive stance.

net assets
There is no logical reason why sales should increase as a result of a more aggressive
working capital policy. The reasoning behind this assumption is unclear.

Return on net assets =

Recommended course of action
The conclusion to be drawn from the figures in (b) above is that substantial funds can be released
by moving from a conservative to an aggressive working capital position ($4.40m – $2.28m =
$2.12m). These funds could be repaid to shareholders, invested or used to reduce borrowings
depending on the company's situation.
Moderate working capital position
My first recommendation is that the company should attempt to move towards a moderate working
capital position by tightening up its debt collection procedures, buying inventory in smaller
batches and negotiating longer credit periods from suppliers. Our small size does not help us in
this respect but, if achievable, this would result in a significant increase in return on net assets and
an acceptable current ratio.
Use of modern techniques
However, further moves towards more aggressive working capital arrangements should be the
outcome rather than the driver of policy changes. The key changes that need to be made in our firm
are concerned with the adoption of modern supply chain and manufacturing techniques. These
will enable us not only to reduce working capital while avoiding system breakdown but also to
improve quality and flexibility and to increase customer demand. At the moment, we have modern
equipment but are not taking full advantage of its potential. I therefore recommend that a
comprehensive study of our key business processes is undertaken. I will be happy to evaluate the
financial effects of the possible scenarios.

Top tips. There isn't much to calculate here so just make sure you know your receivable days formula and
think about the relationship between receivables and cash flow.

Most of the marks on this question are for a discussion of working capital in one form or another. So think
about sources of finance and policies for managing working capital.
(a)

Receivables are currently taking on average ($550,000/$4,000,000) 365 = 50 days to pay. This is
in excess of Velm's stated terms. The discount, to be taken up by 2/3 of customers, will cost the
company $4,000,000 1% 2/3 = $26,667. It is stated that this will bring the receivables'
payment period down to 26 days, which is represented by a new receivables level of $4,000,000
26/365 = $284,932. This is a reduction in receivables of $265,068. At current overdraft costs of
9%, this would be a saving of $265,068 0.09 = $23,856.
Bad debts would decrease from 3% to 2.4% of revenue, which saves a total of $4,000,000
= $24,000. There would also be a salary saving from early retirement of $12,000.
So the net effect on Velm's profitability is as follows:
$

Decreased bad debts

Less: cost of discount

(b)

Short-term sources of finance include overdrafts and short-term loans. Long-term sources of
finance include loan notes and long-term loans. The choice is between cheaper but riskier
short-term finance and more expensive but less risky long-term debt. A customer might ask the
bank for a short term overdraft facility when the bank would wish to suggest a loan instead;
alternatively, a customer might ask for a loan when an overdraft would be more appropriate.
In most cases, when a customer wants finance to help with 'day to day' trading and cash flow
needs, an overdraft would be the appropriate method of financing. The customer should not be
short of cash all the time, and should expect to be in credit in some days, but in need of an
overdraft on others.
When a customer wants to borrow from a bank for only a short period of time, even for the
purchase of a major non-current asset such as an item of plant or machinery, an overdraft facility
might be more suitable than a loan, because the customer will stop paying interest as soon as his
account goes into credit.
However, when a customer wants to borrow from a bank, but cannot see his way to repaying the
bank except over the course of a few years, the required financing is best catered for by the
provision of a loan rather than an overdraft facility.
Advantages of an overdraft over a loan

(i)

The customer only pays interest when they are overdrawn.

(ii)

The bank has the flexibility to review the customer's overdraft facility periodically, and
perhaps agree to additional facilities, or insist on a reduction in the facility.

(iii)

An overdraft can do the same job as a loan: a facility can simply be renewed every time it
comes up for review.

(iv)

Being short-term debt, an overdraft will not affect the calculation of a company's gearing.

Bear in mind, however, that overdrafts are technically repayable on demand, so even though they
are cheaper than longer term sources of debt finance, they are more risky.
Advantages of a long term loan

(i)

Both the customer and the bank know exactly what the repayments of the loan will be and
how much interest is payable, and when. This makes planning (budgeting) simpler.

(ii)

The customer does not have to worry about the bank deciding to reduce or withdraw an
overdraft facility before he or she is in a position to repay what is owed. There is an element
of 'security' or 'peace of mind' in being able to arrange a loan for an agreed term. However,
long term finance is generally more expensive than short term finance.

(iii)

Loans normally carry a facility letter setting out the precise terms of the agreement.

Working capital policies can be characterised as conservative, moderate and aggressive. A
conservative policy would finance working capital needs primarily from long term sources of
finance, so all long term assets and some fluctuating current assets. However, Velm Co is following
an aggressive financing policy as long term debt only makes up 2.75% (40/1,450) of non-cash
current assets and most finance is provided by short term debt ($1,530k).

(c)

As a general rule, assets which yield profits over a long period of time should be financed by
long-term funds. This is an application of the matching principle.
In this way, the returns made by the asset will be sufficient to pay either the interest cost of the
loans raised to buy it, or dividends on its equity funding.
If, however a long-term asset is financed by short-term funds, the company cannot be certain that
when the loan becomes repayable, it will have enough cash (from profits) to repay it.
Under a moderate or matching approach, a company would normally finance short-term assets
partly with short-term funding and partly with long-term funding. However, Velm appears to be
conducting an aggressive financing policy, as short term finance is being used for most of its
current assets. This is a higher risk source of finance.

Top tips. An exam question would not consist purely of calculations; it would also most likely include
discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of the NPV and IRR methods.

This question nevertheless does give you lots of practice in the techniques and highlights common traps.
Depreciation is not a cash flow and should be eliminated. If you have to deal with working capital you need
to read the question very carefully. In C the increase in working capital from $15,000 to $21,000 at the end
of year 1 is an increase of the difference between the figures ($6,000) at the end of year 1. The question
also tells you that the working capital investment will be recovered, so that figure ultimately has to be
included as a receipt.
The question also requires you to calculate annuities and perpetuities, and deal with cash flows that are
constant over a number of years but do not start at year 1. The treatment of the discount rate may have
caught you out if you didn't read the question carefully. The discount rate of 15% should be used
throughout the duration of all projects lasting more than ten years, and not just from year 10 onwards.
You can use the NPV calculations for A and C as the first rates in the IRR estimation process. The fact that
the NPV for C was rather larger than A indicates that you should try a different second rate. The main thing
is to pick two higher rates as the NPVs were positive; you would get equal credit if you had chosen any
rate in the 15 – 20% band for your second IRR calculation. (Below 15% would probably be a bit too near
to the 12%, but you would be unlikely to be penalised very heavily for using 13% or 14%).

Top tips. In (a), if you failed to identify which costs were relevant correctly, make sure you understand
why. Part (c) makes the important point about sensitivity of cash flows. Even if a project has a positive
NPV, or an acceptable IRR, a company may not go ahead if the profits are felt to be too marginal, and the
risk of loss too great.

(a)

Incremental cash flows

The survey has been undertaken already, even though it has not yet been paid for, and therefore the
$30,000 is a sunk cost.
The depreciation charge of $15,000 is not a cash-flow. The re-allocated fixed overheads will be
incurred whether or Mezen goes ahead with the product. Both of these amounts may be subtracted
from the $25,000 of fixed overheads in the original calculations.
The company forgoes $70,000 of immediate income from the sale of the machine.

The product has a positive net present value and an IRR that exceeds the company's cost of
capital, and this suggests that it should be launched.
The decision is very marginal, however. It would certainly not be worthwhile if the market survey
had not yet been commissioned, in which case the cost of $30,000 would need to be included. A
relatively small drop in sales or a small increase in costs would result in a negative NPV. The
company may well be able to find better uses for the $20,000 that will be spent now, and for the
immediate income of $70,000 on the sale of the machine.

= $70,000
= $70,000
= $70,000
= $22,082

Therefore if the net cash flows reduce from $32,500 per annum to $22,082 per annum the net
present value will be zero. This is a reduction of $10,418.

NPV calculations

It is assumed that the after-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital is the appropriate cost of capital
to use, although the method of financing implied in the managing director's estimates of interest charges
for the project raises questions about what the most appropriate cost of capital should be.

The internal rate of return (IRR) is the rate of return that results in a NPV of zero. The rule with the
internal rate of return (IRR) method of project evaluation is that a project should be undertaken if
it is expected to achieve a return in excess of the company's cost of capital. A project that has an
IRR in excess of the cost of capital must have a positive NPV.
Strengths

The main advantage of the IRR method is that the information it provides may be more easily
understood by managers, especially non-financial managers.
It is sometimes said that IRR is difficult to calculate, but both NPV and IRR are actually very easy
to calculate with a spreadsheet.
Weaknesses

However, it might be tempting for some managers to confuse IRR and accounting return on capital
employed (ROCE). The accounting ROCE and the IRR are two completely different measures. If
managers were given information about both ROCE (or ROI) and IRR, it might be easy to get their
relative meaning and significance mixed up.
The IRR method also ignores the relative size of investments: for example a project with an
annual return of $50 on an initial investment of $100 would have the same IRR as a project with an
annual return of $5,000 on an initial investment of $10,000, although the latter is clearly preferable.
IRR favours projects that are less sensitive to increases in the discount rate and therefore the
IRR method may sometimes indicate that a project that yields a smaller increase in shareholder
wealth should be preferred to one that yields a larger increase, whereas the opposite is the case.
NPV should therefore be used to decide between mutually exclusive projects.

Top tips. (a) allows you to demonstrate that you understand the topic of real and nominal returns by
explaining the difference between them.

(b) introduces the complication of what you should do if you are told what current (or year 1) prices are
but are also given information about price increases over the period of investment. Because the costs are
increasing at different rates, the nominal rate (which you are given) has to be used, and the revenues and
costs inflated each year. If the rate of increase for everything had been the same, you could either have
used the nominal rate (and inflated costs and revenues), or calculated the real rate (and used uninflated
costs and revenues). Since calculating the real rate only involves one calculation, you should really have
chosen that option.
Again don't forget to exclude depreciation as it is not a cash flow. Development costs of $480,000 are
sunk costs and should also be excluded from the calculation. Because you are told to confine your answer
to the information given, you should not discuss any wider issues that might be involved in the
investment.
(a)

The real rate of return is the rate of return which an investment would show in the absence of
inflation. For example, if a company invests $100, inflation is 0%, and the investment at the end of
the year is worth $110, then the real rate of return is 10%.
In reality however, there is likely to be an element of inflation in the returns due to the change in the
purchasing power of money over the period. In the example above, if inflation was running at 5%,
then to show a real rate of return of 10%, the investment would need to be worth $115.50 at the
end of the year. In this case the nominal rate of return is 15.5% which is made up of the real return
of 10% and inflation at 5%.
The relationship between the nominal ('money') rate of return and the real rate of return can be
expressed as follows:
(1 + nominal rate) = (1 + real rate)

Top tips. A methodical set of workings is key to answering this question well (also not confusing the
adjustment factors for costs and benefits).

Apart from testing your ability to use the certainty-equivalent approach, the question is a good test of your
understanding of relevant costs and opportunity costs.


Apportioned costs are not incurred by the project and should not be included.



Only the additional element of other overheads should be included.



The current assistant manager's salary of $30,000 will be incurred anyway and should not be
included; the $27,000 salary of the new manager should however be included since it has been
incurred because the current assistant manager is needed on the project.



The company will not be able to obtain the rental of $135,000 on the factory space if it undertakes
the project; thus the rental is an opportunity cost which should be included.



The 60,000 kg of material X currently in inventory should not be included at purchase price since
this is a sunk cost. However by undertaking the project, the company forgoes the opportunity to
sell the raw materials in inventory, and they should thus be included at selling price.

Top tips. This question gives you practice in doing NPV calculations rapidly. Note how the NPV
calculations are laid out in a way that enables you to show clearly how the profitability index is calculated.
It would be less time consuming to use the proforma we have used than to do the NPV calculations, and
then separately to do the profitability index calculations. What this emphasises is the usefulness of taking
a few moments to plan the most efficient way of carrying out calculations.

In (b) because of the constraints you have to calculate the combined NPV of various possible
combinations. It is obvious looking at the figures that the company will be undertaking some combination
of three of the projects. However you would be penalised (and waste time) if you calculated the NPV of all
combinations of three of the six. Any combinations including C should be excluded as the project makes a
loss. It is also not possible for a combination to include A and E as they are mutually exclusive.
Our answer shows only those possible combinations of projects that cost less than $620,000. It would
also be fine if you showed the cost of combinations that cost more than $620,000; however you should
have then stated that they could not be undertaken, and should not have calculated their NPV.
(a)

The profitability index will be calculated as the ratio of the PV of net cash inflows to the year 0
capital outlay.

Project C comes sixth and last in the ranking according to both NPV and profitability index. It has a
negative NPV and should not be undertaken.
Banden cannot afford to undertake more than three projects, given the maximum available capital
of $620,000. It should not undertake project C, and it cannot undertake A and E simultaneously.

Banden should not invest any funds in the money markets, because the return would only be 9%
p.a. and the cost of capital for Banden is higher, at 12% p.a.
It is assumed that the company does not have to use more funds than it needs to, and so there will
not be any surplus funds which have to be invested somewhere.
Recommendation. The company should use $576,000 and invest in projects D, F and A.

Top tips. A table setting out each element of unit cost is helpful. When doing the NPV calculations it is
important to show them, but show them in a way that minimises the writing you have to do. If you were
not able to fit your answer to (a) across the page, you could have stated the discount factors at the start of
the answer and then done the calculations. Note also that we have taken the short cut of using annuity
factors. Don't forget the 'reclaiming of working capital' in year 5.

In (b) you are using total inflows to calculate the profitability index, not net present value. When setting
out your workings a column on cumulative outlay should help you ensure you take the correct proportion
of the partial project.
(c) starts off by stating the assumptions, and then goes on to discuss complications in which the NPV
approach could not be used.
(a)

The first step is to calculate the annual contribution from each project, together with the working
capital cash flows. These cash flows, together with the initial outlay, can then be discounted at the
cost of capital to arrive at the NPV of each project. Development costs already incurred are
irrelevant. There are no additional administration costs associated with the projects, and
depreciation is also irrelevant since it has no cash effect.
First, calculate annual contribution.

The profitability index provides a means of optimising the NPV when there are more projects
available which yield a positive NPV than funds to invest in them. The profitability index measures
the ratio of the present value of cash inflows to the initial outlay and represents the net present
value per $1 invested.

The profitability index (PI) approach can be applied only if the projects under consideration fulfil
certain criteria, such as:
(i)

There is only one constraint on investment, in this case capital. The PI ensures that
maximum return per unit of scarce resource (capital) is obtained.

(ii)

Each investment can be accepted or rejected in its entirety or alternatively accepted on a
partial basis.

(iii)

The NPV generated by a given project is directly proportional to the percentage of the
investment undertaken.

If additional funds are available but at a higher cost, then the simple PI approach cannot be used
since it is not possible to calculate unambiguous individual NPVs.
If certain of the projects that may be undertaken are mutually exclusive then sub-problems must
be defined and calculations made for different combinations of projects.
Possibly a more serious constraint is the assumption that the company's only concern is to
maximise NPV. It is possible that there may be long-term strategic reasons which mean that an
investment with a lower NPV should be undertaken instead of one with a higher NPV, and the ratio
approach takes no account of the relative degrees of risk associated with making the different
investments.

If the investor either takes up the rights issue or sells their rights then his wealth will remain the
same. The difference is that if they take up the rights issue they will maintain their relative
shareholding but if they sell their rights their percentage shareholding will fall, although they will
gain $700 in cash.
However if the investor allows the rights to lapse their wealth will decrease by $700.

Sagitta clearly needs to raise $47.04m which is why it was decided to make a one for five rights
issue of 48 million additional shares at a price of $0.98. Provided that this amount is raised it could
have been done (for example) by issuing 96 million new shares as a two for five rights issue with
the issue price at $0.49 per share.
The price of the issue and the number of shares should not be important in a competitive market
as the value of the business will not change and nor will the shareholders' percentage
shareholding.
However the critical factor about the price of the rights issue is that it must be below the market
value at the time of the rights issue. If the rights issue price is higher than the market value then
there is no incentive to shareholders to purchase the additional shares and the rights issue will fail.
As far as the business is concerned the details of the rights issue including the price must be
determined a considerable time before the rights issue actually takes place, therefore there is
always the risk that the share price might fall in the intervening period.

(e)

A Murabaha transaction is a form of credit sale. There is an immediate transfer of an asset, with the
buyer making payment in the future (possibly in instalments). The total payment will include a
mark-up on the value of the asset in recognition of the convenience of paying later. The asset can
be sold to raise funds for the future payment. There is a contract between the buyer and the seller
stating the value of the asset transferred and the mark-up amount.
A conventional loan has capital borrowed and then interest is to be repaid on top and there is no
transfer of an asset to the borrower. For a Murabaha transaction, there must be an underlying asset
that exists and has a value within a fair market range. Although the asset can vary for transactions
it must not be prohibited by Sharia'a. Another difference is that in Murabaha transactions
penalties for late payments that would profit the seller are not allowed.
In Islamic finance riba (or interest) is forbidden, therefore under Murabaha there is an agreed upon
mark-up, which should allow both parties to share in the profit from the sale of the asset.

15 Headwater
Top tips. The bulk of the marks in (a) would be available for the written comparisons with the rest of the
industry, particularly as you are told which ratios to calculate rather than having to select them yourself.
You need to provide sensible explanations for differences with the industry and highlight areas for
concern, in particular here the problems over sources of finance.

In (b) you need to show that the company can gain more funds not only because more investors can put
money in, but also that listed status provides more reasons for investors to buy a stake (improved
marketability of shares being probably the most important).
When answering (c) you should examine the statement of financial position and consider how different
elements might be made more attractive to investors. This includes looking at share capital and
considering whether the issue price of each share is likely to be too high.
(a)

The performance and financial health of Headwater in relation to that of the industry sector as a
whole can be evaluated by comparing its financial ratios with the industry averages, as follows.
Headwater

Industry average

Return on (long-term) capital employed

4.0

Interest cover
Profit before interest and tax (PBIT): Interest
$4.9m: $1.3m = 3.77 times

4.5

These ratios can be used to evaluate performance in terms of profitability, liquidity and financial
security.
Profitability

Headwater's return on capital employed, return on equity and operating profit margin are all
significantly above the industry averages. Although the first two measures could be inflated due to
assets being shown at low book values, the profit margin indicates that Headwater is managing to
make good profits, which could be due to successful marketing, a low cost base or to its
occupation of a particularly profitable niche in the market.

Liquidity

Both the current and the quick (acid test) ratios are well below the industry averages. This suggests
that Headwater is either short of liquid resources or is managing its working capital poorly.
However, the three key working capital ratios modify this impression.
Receivables days:
365
Inventory turnover: 365
Payment period:
365

4.7/36.5 = 47 days
4.4/31.6 = 51 days
7.0/31.6 = 81 days

Although the industry averages are not known, these ratios appear to be very good by general
standards. It therefore appears that Headwater has become under-capitalised, perhaps through the
use of working capital to finance growth.
Financial security
Gearing is high in comparison with the rest of the industry, and 48% of the debt is in the form of
overdraft which is generally repayable on demand. This is therefore a risky form of debt to use in
large amounts. The debenture is repayable in two years and will need to be refinanced since
Headwater cannot redeem it out of existing resources. Interest cover is also poor, and this together
with the poor liquidity probably account for the low payout ratio (the inverse of the dividend cover).

In summary, profit performance is strong, but there are significant weaknesses in both the liquidity
and the financial structure. These problems need to be addressed if Headwater is to be able to
maintain its record of strong and consistent growth.
(b)

(c)

A company such as Headwater may seek a stock market listing for the following reasons.
(i)

To allow access to a wider pool of finance: companies that are growing fast may need to
raise larger sums than is possible privately. Obtaining a listing widens the potential number
of equity investors, and may also result in an improved credit rating, thus reducing the cost
of additional debt finance.

(ii)

To improve the marketability of the shares: shares that are traded on the stock market can
be bought and sold in relatively small quantities at any time. This means that it is easier for
existing investors to realise a part of their holding.

(iii)

To allow capital to be transferred to other ventures: founder owners may wish to liquidate
the major part of their holding either for personal reasons or for investment in other new
business opportunities.

(iv)

To improve the company image: quoted companies are commonly believed to be more
financially stable, and this may improve the image of the company with its customers and
suppliers, allowing it to gain additional business and to improve its buying power.

(v)

Growth by acquisition is easier: a listed company is in a better position to make a paper
offer for a target company than an unlisted one.

Restructuring its statement of financial position prior to flotation will help to make Headwater
appear a sounder prospect to potential investors who know little about its past performance.
Methods available include the following.
Disposal of surplus assets. This will improve both gearing and liquidity.
Non-current asset revaluation. Land and buildings may well be shown in the accounts at values
that are significantly below the current market valuation. Adjustment to market values will improve
the gearing ratio and the value of shareholders' funds, although the effect of this will be to depress
the reported return on capital employed and return on equity. However, since these are currently
well above industry averages this should not present too much of a problem.
Liquidity improvement. Although there does not appear to be much scope for tightening the
control of working capital, Headwater may be able to improve its cash flow by other means, for
example by reducing overheads and delaying the purchase of additional fixed assets.

Sale and leaseback. If Headwater owns valuable freehold premises it may be able to release cash
by selling them and exchanging the freehold for a lease.
Elimination of non-voting 'A' shares. These are not permitted by the Stock Exchange for
companies newly entering the market.
Share split. On the basis of the industry average P/E of 10, the shares would be priced at
$11.48 (= 10 3.1m/(1.8m + 0.9m)). A highly priced new issue is likely to deter potential small
investors. This problem could be overcome by reducing the nominal value of the shares by means
of a share split.

16 ABC
Top tips. The wisdom of the dividend policy each company adopts is somewhat dependent upon its
current and future plans – whether in fact it can make 'better' use of the profits by re-investing them. The
answer stresses the importance of stability in dividend payments – this is a very important 'real-world'
issue. The scrip issues and other concessions by C are unlikely to be harmful, although their positive
effect may not be very great.

The key element in the second part of the question is the clientele effect. You need to stress the
importance of the shareholders' tax position here.
A's policy

Company A, which has deliberately avoided paying any dividends in the last five years, is pursuing a
sensible policy for a rapidly growing company. All its post-tax profits are being reinvested in the
company's business. By adopting this strategy, Company A reduces to a minimum its need to raise new
capital from the market. Issue costs are reduced or eliminated and the company has greater flexibility in
its investment programme since decision taking is not dependent on gaining market approval.
Furthermore, since the company is probably investing heavily its taxation liability may well be small.
B's policy

At first sight the policy pursued by Company B, of distributing 50% of post-tax profits, appears to offer the
shareholders predictability. In fact, however, with changes in the company's operating profits and in the
tax regime, the post-tax earnings may fluctuate considerably. Reducing the dividend of a quoted company
normally causes its share price to fall sharply, since the market takes this as casting considerable doubt
on its future earnings potential. But, the more mature and predictable that Company B's business is, the
greater the merit in its dividend policy. A mature business usually needs less new capital investment than
a growing one and so a higher level of dividend is justified. Distributing profits allows shareholders to
make some adjustment to the risk and return profile of their portfolios without incurring the transaction
costs of buying and selling.
C's policy

Company C's policy falls between those of A and B in that a dividend is paid, albeit a small one. The
predictability of the dividend will be welcomed by shareholders, since it allows them to make their
financial plans with more certainty than would otherwise be possible. It also gives C part of A's advantage;
retained earnings can be used as the principal source of investment capital. To the extent that they are
relevant at all, scrip issues are likely to increase a company's market value, since they are often made to
increase the marketability of the shares. Shareholder concessions are simply a means of attracting the
'small' shareholder who can benefit from them personally, and have no impact on dividend policy.
Effect on shareholders

In addition to looking at the cash flows of each company, we must also consider the impact of these
dividend policies on the after tax wealth of shareholders. Shareholders can be divided into groups or
'clienteles'. Different clienteles may be attracted to invest in each of the three firms, depending on their
tax situation. It is worth noting that one clientele is as good as another in terms of the valuation it implies
for the firm.

Company A would be particularly attractive to individuals who do not require an income stream from their
investment and prefer to obtain a return through capital growth. Company B's clientele prefer a much
higher proportion of their return to be in the form of income, although it would not be income on which
they rely since it may be very variable from year to year. Tax exempt funds, such as pension funds, are
indifferent between returns in the form of income or capital and might well invest in B since they need a
flow of income to meet their day to day obligations. A large, diversified portfolio would reduce the effect of
variability in the dividend. Company C is more likely to appeal to the private investor since most of the
return is in the form of capital growth and there are shareholder concessions too.
So, each company may maximise the wealth of its shareholders. If the theorists are right, A, B and C all
maximise shareholder wealth because the value of the companies is unaffected by dividend policy.
Alternatively, each company's group of shareholders may favour their company's policy (and so their
wealth is maximised) because the dividend policy is appropriate to their tax position and so maximises
their post-tax returns.

17 DF
Top tips. The nature of the calculation in (a) should have suggested to you that the majority of marks
would be available for the discussion. The answer looks well beyond the relationship with FF, considering
the effect on relations with other customers, the effect on DF itself, and whether there are alternative
sources of finance for DF.

(b) goes on to cover those alternative sources of finance. Various criteria can be used to consider them:


Costs (including costs saved)



Flexibility (a company knows when and how much interest and principal it has to pay on a loan
but still has to pay it; by contrast an overdraft facility only has interest charged on it if it is used,
but it is repayable on demand.)



Commitment (security that has to be given, how much the company is tied into the arrangement)



Appearances (effect on gearing, effect on accounts receivable if factor organisation is employed)

Although the question directs you towards discussing certain sources of finance, it does not confine you
to those sources. Therefore, although the bulk of your answer to (b) should discuss the sources listed, a
section briefly mentioning other sources should also be included.
Don't forget also in (b) to bear in mind the likely level of financial knowledge of the recipients of your
report; don't assume a high level of understanding.

Alternative methods of financing current assets

Introduction

The contract to supply FF means that DF will need to make a significant additional permanent
investment in current assets (in the form of additional inventories and higher accounts receivable).
There will also be an additional temporary element which fluctuates with the level of sales. This will
increase the amount of money needed by the company to finance these assets. There are a number
of different sources of finance that could be considered.
Bank loan

A bank loan would normally be for a fixed amount of money for a fixed term and at a fixed rate of
interest. It is not clear whether or not the company has any existing debt finance. However, it has
already been decided to use a bank loan to fund the purchase of the additional non-current assets.
The size of this loan and the quality of security available will be key factors in determining whether
the bank is willing to make a further advance to cover the investment in current assets. Assuming
that a further loan is forthcoming, the company will need to evaluate the effect of this in terms of
cost and the effect on the capital structure.
Advantages of bank loan

(i)

Bank finance is cheaper than the cost of allowing a 3% settlement discount, and is also
likely to be cheaper than using debt factoring or invoice discounting.

(ii)

The loan can be negotiated for a fixed term and a fixed amount, and this is less risky than
for example using an overdraft, which is repayable on demand.

Disadvantages of bank loan

(i)

The company will have to pay interest on the full amount of the loan for the entire period.
This could make it more expensive in absolute terms than using an alternative source of
finance where interest is only payable on the amount outstanding.

(ii)

The loan will increase the level of the company's financial gearing. This means that there
could be greater volatility in the returns attributable to the ordinary shareholders.

(iii)

The bank is likely to require security. If there are questions as to the quality of the asset
base, the bank may also require personal guarantees or additional security from the
directors or shareholders.

Overdraft

An overdraft is a form of lending that is repayable on demand. The bank grants the customer a
facility up to a certain limit, and the customer can take advantage of this as necessary. Overdrafts
are essentially short-term finance, but are renewable and may become a near-permanent source.
Advantages of overdraft

The attraction of using an overdraft to finance current assets is that interest is only payable on the
amount of the facility actually in use at any one time. This means that the effective cost of the
overdraft will be lower than that of the bank loan. This is particularly attractive for a company such
as DF, where demand is expected to fluctuate significantly from month to month, and consequently
there are likely to be large variations in the level of working capital. It is also likely to be cheaper
than the other alternatives being considered.
Disadvantages of overdraft

The main drawback to using an overdraft is that it will be repayable on demand, and therefore the
company is in a more vulnerable position than it would be if a bank loan were used instead. A longterm overdraft may be included in the gearing calculations, and the bank may require security.
Debt factoring

Factoring is an arrangement to have debts collected by a factor company, which advances a
proportion of the money it is due to collect. Services offered by the factor would normally include
the following:
(i)

Administration of the client's invoicing, sales accounting and debt collection service.

(ii)

Credit protection for the client's debts, whereby the factor takes over the risk of loss from
bad debts and so 'insures' the client against such losses.

(iii)

Making advance payments to the client before the debts are collected.

Benefits of factoring

(i)

Growth is effectively financed through sales, which provide the security to the factor. DF
would not have to provide the additional security that might be required by the bank.

(ii)

The managers of the business will not have to spend time on the problem of slow paying
accounts receivable.

(iii)

Administration costs will be reduced since the company will not have to run its own sales
ledger department.

Disadvantages of factoring

(i)

The level of finance is geared to the level of sales; in other words, finance lags sales. In
practice, DF will need finance ahead of sales in order to build up sufficient inventorys to
meet demand.

(ii)

Factoring may be more expensive than bank finance. Service charges are generally around
2% of total invoice value, in addition to finance charges at levels comparable to bank
overdraft rates.

(iii)

The fact that accounts receivable will be making payments direct to the factor may present a
negative picture of the firm.

Invoice discounting

Invoice discounting is related to factoring and many factors will provide an invoice discounting
service. Invoice discounting is the purchase of a selection of invoices, at a discount. The
discounter does not take over the administration of the client's sales ledger, and the arrangement
is purely for the advance of cash.

496

Practice answer bank

w


Advantages of discounting

The arrangement is thus a purely financial transaction that can be used to release working capital,
and therefore shares some of the benefits of factoring in that further security is not required. The
discounter will make an assessment of the risk involved, and only good quality invoices will be
purchased, but this should not be a problem to DF since FF is a large well established company.
Disadvantages of discounting

The main disadvantage is that invoice discounting is likely to be more expensive than any of the
other alternatives. It is normally only used to cover a temporary cash shortage, and not for the
routine provision of working capital.
Other options

(i)

Finance can be obtained by delaying payment to accounts payable. In theory this is
potentially a cheap source of finance. The main disadvantage may be a loss of supplier
goodwill, at a time when the company needs supplier co-operation to fulfil the new order.

(ii)

Other methods of loan finance, notably debenture issue, are not appropriate as they are
essentially long-term, and the debenture holders may require security that the company is
unable to give.

(iii)

Although we are told that increased inventory levels will be needed to fulfil FF's
requirements, there may be scope for reducing the inventory levels necessary to fulfil
other customers' requirements.

Conclusions

Of the options considered, factoring or some form of bank finance is likely to be the most
appropriate. The final decision must take into account the full cost implications, and not just the
relative rates of interest on the finance. DF must also consider the effect of the type of finance
selected on the statement of financial position, and the type of security that will be required. This
could also impact on the ability of the company to raise further finance in the future.

Top tips. (a) Demonstrates the complications that may occur in weighted average cost of capital
calculations.

With loan notes, the most serious mistake you can make is to treat redeemable loan notes as
irredeemable. Because the loan notes are redeemable, you need to carry out an IRR analysis. Remember
this calculation is done from the viewpoint of the investor. The investor pays the market price for the loan
notes at time 0, and then receives the interest and the conversion value in subsequent years. You must
bring tax into your calculation, although you could have assumed that tax was paid with a one year time
delay.
Lastly don't forget that the weightings in the WACC calculation are based on market values, not book
values.
(b) Demonstrates that the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital is not a purely mechanical
process. It makes assumptions about the shareholders, the proposed investment and the company's
capital structure and future dividend prospects. Given all the assumptions involved, the result of the
calculations may need to be taken with a large pinch of salt!

7% Loan notes

In order to find the post-tax cost of the loan notes, which are redeemable in ten years time,
it is necessary to find the discount rate (IRR) which will give the future post-tax cash flows
a present value of $77.10.
The relevant cash flows for a single loan note with a nominal value of $100 are:
(1)

Annual interest payments, net of tax, which are $100
(for ten years)

(2)

A capital repayment of $100 (in ten years time)

7%

70% = $4.90

It is assumed that tax relief on the loan note interest arises at the same time as the interest
payment. In practice the cash flow effect is unlikely to be felt for about a year, but this will
have no significant effect on the calculations.

The above calculations suggest that a discount rate in the region of 16% might be
appropriate for the appraisal of new investment opportunities.
(b)

Difficulties and uncertainties in the above estimates arise in a number of areas.
(i)

The cost of equity. The above calculation assumes that all shareholders have the same
marginal cost of capital and the same dividend expectations, which is unrealistic. In
addition, it is assumed that dividend growth has been and will be at a constant rate of 6.9%.
In fact, actual growth in the years 20X5/6 and 20X8/9 was in excess of 9%, while in the year
20X7/8 there was no dividend growth. 6.9% is merely the average rate of growth for the
past four years. The rate of future growth will depend more on the return from future
projects undertaken than on the past dividend record.

(ii)

The use of the weighted average cost of capital. Use of the weighted average cost of
capital as a discount rate is only justified where the company in question has achieved what
it believes to be the optimal capital structure (the mix of debt and equity) and where it
intends to maintain this structure in the long term.

(iii)

The projects themselves. The weighted average cost of capital makes no allowance for the
business risk of individual projects. In practice some companies, having calculated the
WACC, then add a premium for risk. In this case, for example, if one used a risk premium of
5% the final discount rate would be 21%. Ideally the risk premium should vary from project
to project, since not all projects are equally risky. In general, the riskier the project the
higher the discount rate which should be used.

Sources of finance

The sources of long-term finance for Katash are ordinary shares and loan notes and the rate of
return expected by investors depends on the relative risks of each type of finance. Equity is the
most risky and therefore has the highest cost of capital. The loan notes are the least risky with the
lowest cost of capital.
Therefore, if we ignore taxation, the weighted average cost of capital would be expected to
decrease if equity is replaced by debt.
Traditional view

In the traditional view of capital structure, ordinary shareholders are relatively indifferent to the
addition of small amounts of debt so the WACC falls as a company gears up.
However, as equity is replaced by debt and gearing increases, financial risk will increase so the
cost of equity will rise and this will offset the effect of cheaper debt.
The before-tax cost of debt will also increase at high levels of gearing due to the risk of bankruptcy.
This bankruptcy risk will further increase the cost of equity.
A company can therefore gear up using debt and reduce its WACC to a minimum. When the WACC
is minimised, the market value of the company, equal to the present value of its cash flows, will be
maximised.
Beyond this minimum point, the WACC will increase due to the effect of increasing financial and
bankruptcy risk.
Modigliani and Miller

In contrast to this traditional view, Modigliani and Miller, assuming a perfect market and ignoring
tax, demonstrated that the WACC remained constant as a company increased its gearing. They
argued that the increase in the cost of equity due to financial risk exactly balanced the decrease in
WACC caused by the lower before-tax cost of debt.
In a perfect capital market, there is no bankruptcy risk so the WACC and therefore the market value
of the company is constant at all gearing levels. The market value of a company depends on its
business risk only. This means that Katash cannot change its WACC.
However, corporate tax does exist and interest payments on debt reduce tax liability. It could thus
be argued that WACC falls as gearing increases, and Katash could therefore reduce its WACC to a
minimum by taking on as much debt as possible.
The assumption of a perfect capital market is unrealistic. Bankruptcy risk and other costs of
servicing debt will increase as gearing increases and this will offset the value of the tax shield.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Katash should be able to reduce its WACC by gearing up, but the minimum WACC
achievable may be hard to determine.

20 Bases of valuation
Top tips. It is important that you have a good understanding of this topic area in order to pass the FM
exam. The idea of this question is to get you thinking about some of the key issues. However, section C
questions in the real exam will mainly focus on other syllabus areas – working capital, investment
appraisal and business finance.

(a)

(i)

Statement of financial position value = $ (2,070,600 – 1,616,500) = $454,100.

(ii)

Replacement cost value = $454,100 + $(725,000 – 651,600) + $(550,000 – 515,900) =
$561,600.

(iii)

Realisable value = $454,100 + $(450,000 – 651,600) + (570,000 – 515,900) – $14,900 =
$291,700.

Bad debts are 2% $745,000 = $14,900. Bad debts are assumed not to be relevant to
statement of financial position and replacement cost values.
(iv)

The dividend growth model value depends on an estimate of growth, which is far from
clear given the wide variations in earnings over the five years.
1

The lowest possible value, assuming zero growth, is as follows.
Value ex div =

$25,000
0.12

$208,333

It is not likely that this will be the basis taken.
2

Looking at dividend growth over the past five years we have:
20X4 dividend = $25,000
20X0 dividend = $20,500.
If the annual growth rate in dividends is g
(1 + g)4 =

(25,000)
1.2195
20,500

1 + g = 1.0508
g = 0.0508, say 5.1%
Then, MV ex div

=

Dividend in 1 year
0.12 g

=

25,000(1.051)

= $380,797

P/E ratio model

Comparable quoted companies to Manon have P/E ratios of about 10. Manon is much
smaller and being unquoted its P/E ratio would be less than 10, but how much less?
If we take a P/E ratio of 5, we have MV = $52,200
If we take a P/E ratio of 10

5 = $261,000.

2/3, we have MV = $52,200

10

2/3 = $348,000.

If we take a P/E ratio of 10, we have MV = $522,000.
(b)

(i)

The statement of financial position value

The statement of financial position value should not play a part in the negotiation process.
Historical costs are not relevant to a decision on the future value of the company.
(ii)

The replacement cost

This gives the cost of setting up a similar business. Since this gives a higher figure than any
other valuation in this case, it could show the maximum price for Carmen to offer. There is
clearly no goodwill to value.
(iii)

The realisable value

This shows the cash which the shareholders in Manon could get by liquidating the
business. It is therefore the minimum price which they would accept.
All the methods (i) to (iii) suffer from the limitation that they do not look at the going
concern value of the business as a whole. Methods (iv) and (v) do consider this value.
However, the realisable value is of use in assessing the risk attached to the business as a
going concern, as it gives the base value if things go wrong and the business has to be
abandoned.
(iv)

The dividend model

The figures have been calculated using Manon's Ke (12%). If (2) or (3) were followed, the
value would be the minimum that Manon's shareholders would accept, as the value in use
exceeds scrap value in (iii). The relevance of a dividend valuation to Carmen will depend on
whether the current retention and reinvestment policies would be continued. Certainly the
value to Carmen should be based on 9% rather than 12%. Both companies are ungeared
and in the same risk class so the different required returns must be due to their relative
sizes and the fact that Carmen's shares are more marketable.
One of the main limitations on the dividend growth model is the problem of estimating the
future value of g.
(v)

The P/E ratio model

The P/E ratio model is an attempt to get at the value which the market would put on a
company like Manon. It does provide an external yardstick, but is a very crude measure. As
already stated, the P/E ratio which applies to larger quoted companies must be lowered to
allow for the size of Manon and the non-marketability of its shares. Another limitation of P/E
ratios is that the ratio is very dependent on the expected future growth of the firm. It is

w

Practice answer bank

503

therefore not easy to find a P/E ratio of a 'similar firm'. However, in practice the P/E model
may well feature in the negotiations over price simply because it is an easily understood
yardstick.

21 Market efficiency
Top tips. It is important that you have a good understanding of this topic area in order to pass the FM
exam. The idea of this question is to get you thinking about some of the key issues. However, section C
questions in the real exam will mainly focus on other syllabus areas – working capital, investment
appraisal and business finance.

The efficient market hypothesis contends that some capital markets (in the UK and US for instance) are
'efficient markets' in which the prices at which securities are traded reflect all the relevant information
available. In other words, this information is freely available to all participants in the market and is fully
reflected in share prices. Further, it is assumed that transaction costs are insignificant and do not
discourage trading in shares, and that no single individual or group of individuals dominates the market.
The theory exists in three forms: weak form, semi-strong form and strong form.
Weak form efficiency

Weak form efficiency contends that prices only change when new factual information becomes available.
Information about past prices is in the public domain and equally available to all players in the market, and
thus if this form of the hypothesis is correct, no one player should be able to outperform the market
consistently. Thus the fact that financial institutions rarely outperform the market on a regular basis lends
weight to this form of the theory.
Semi strong efficiency

The semi-strong form of the theory holds that in addition to responding to information that is publicly
available, the market also reflects all other knowledge that is publicly available and relevant to the share
valuation. Thus to take the example used above, the share prices of companies involved in a takeover bid
will change in advance of the bid being formally announced as the market anticipates the bid. Once again,
this form of the theory is based upon the assumption that all the knowledge upon which share price
movements are based is in the public domain and freely available. Thus no single player or group of
players should be able consistently to outperform the market. This form of the theory is supported by
empirical research which suggests that share price movements do anticipate merger announcements. The
fact that the neither the financial institutions nor any other group of investors regularly beat the market
also supports this version of the hypothesis.
Strong form efficiency
The strong form of the theory holds that the market price of securities reflects all information that is
available. This includes knowledge of past performance and anticipated events as in the semi-strong
form, and also 'insider' knowledge not publicly available. This form can be tested by investigating the
effect on the share price of the effect of releasing a piece of information previously confidential to the firm;
if the strong form of the hypothesis is valid, then this should already be factored into the share value and a
significant price movement should not result. The implication is that this sort of information is only
available to specialists who are in regular contact with the company, such as investment trust managers,
and that as a result they could use their privileged position to outperform other investors. Empirical work
suggests that this form of the hypothesis is not valid, and this is what one would expect since insider
dealing is illegal in the UK.
Why institutions may perform well

If an institution does consistently perform well, it is probably more related to the fund managers'
understanding of the structure of the industries and markets in which they invest, and their ability to hold
a more widely diversified portfolio than the small investor. This means that they are in a better position to
avoid the risk of large losses. The fact that they are in daily contact with the markets also means that they

504

Practice answer bank

w


are in practice able to react more quickly to new information that becomes available than is the small
investor.
Conclusion

Thus the fact that the financial institutions in general do not consistently outperform the market supports
both the weak and semi-strong forms of the efficient market hypothesis.

(ii)

Factors to consider before deciding whether to hedge foreign exchange risk using the
foreign currency markets
Risk-averse strategy

The company should have a clear strategy concerning how much foreign exchange risk it is
prepared to bear. A highly risk-averse or 'defensive' strategy of hedging all transactions is
expensive in terms of commission costs but recognises that floating exchange rates are
very unpredictable and can cause losses high enough to bankrupt the company.
Predictive strategy

An alternative 'predictive' strategy recognises that if all transactions are hedged, then the
chance of currency gains is lost. The company could therefore attempt to forecast foreign
exchange movements and only hedge those transactions where currency losses are
predicted. The fact is that some currencies are relatively predictable (for example, if
inflation is high the currency will devalue and there is little to be gained by hedging
payments in that currency).

w

Practice answer bank

505

This is, of course, a much more risky strategy but in the long run, if predictions are made
sensibly, the strategy should lead to a higher expected value than that of hedging everything
and will incur lower commission costs as well. The risk remains, though, that a single large
uncovered transaction could cause severe problems if the currency moves in the opposite
direction to that predicted.
Best strategy

A sensible strategy for our company could be to set a cash size for a foreign currency
exposure above which all amounts must be hedged, but below this limit a predictive
approach is taken or even, possibly, all amounts are left unhedged.
(b)

The other methods used to hedge exchange rate risk include the following.
Currency of invoice which is where an exporter invoices his foreign customer in his domestic
currency, or an importer arranges with his foreign supplier to be invoiced in his domestic currency.
However, although either the exporter or the importer can avoid any exchange risk in this way, only
one of them can deal in his domestic currency. The other must accept the exchange risk, since
there will be a period of time elapsing between agreeing a contract and paying for the goods
(unless payment is made with the order).
Matching receipts and payments is where a company that expects to make payments and have
receipts in the same foreign currency offsets its payments against its receipts in the currency.
Since the company will be setting off foreign currency receipts against foreign currency payments,
it does not matter whether the currency strengthens or weakens against the company's 'domestic'
currency because there will be no purchase or sale of the currency.
Matching assets and liabilities is where a company which expects to receive a substantial amount
of income in a foreign currency hedges against a weakening of the currency by borrowing in the
foreign currency and using the foreign receipts to repay the loan. For example, US dollar
receivables can be hedged by taking out a US dollar overdraft. In the same way, US dollar trade
payables can be matched against a US dollar bank account which is used to pay the creditors.
Leading and lagging is where a company makes payments in advance or delays payments beyond
their due date in order to take advantage of foreign exchange movements.
Netting is where inter-company balances are netted off before arranging payment. It reduces
foreign exchange purchase costs and there is less loss in interest from having money in transit.
Foreign currency derivatives such as futures contracts, options and swaps can be used to hedge
foreign currency risk.

23 Yields
Top tips. It is important that you have a good understanding of this topic area in order to pass the FM
exam. The idea of this question is to get you thinking about some of the key issues. However, section C
questions in the real exam will mainly focus on other syllabus areas – working capital, investment
appraisal and business finance.

(a)

506

A yield curve is a curve that can be drawn showing the relationship between the yield on an asset
(usually long-term government stocks) and the term to maturity of that same asset. It shows how
the rate of interest (yield) varies with different maturities. To construct a yield curve you need to
gather information about the interest rates on short-term stocks, medium-term stocks and
long-term stocks. These rates can then be plotted on a diagram against the maturity dates of those
same stocks.

Practice answer bank

w


A normal yield curve looks like Figure 1.
Yield

Term to maturity

Figure 1

(b)

Importance of expectations

The shape of the yield curve depends very much on expectations about the future. Reward for
loss of liquidity is likely to remain fairly constant. Reward for possible default is likely to remain
constant also. Reward for the risk of having to cash in before maturity and suffering a loss are also
likely to stay fairly constant. The only factor which will vary widely is expectations – in particular,
expectations about future short-term interest rates.
Expectations about the future level of short-term interest rates are the most important factor in
determining the shape of the yield curve. Although the normal yield curve is upward sloping, with
higher yields being expected for longer maturity periods, expectations of rises in future interest
rates can cause the yield curve to be steeper than the normal curve. Expectations of falls in interest
rates can cause the yield to flatten, or, if substantial falls are expected, to become
downward-sloping (Figure 2).
Steep upward – sloping yield curve

Practice answer bank

507

Rising interest rates

If interest rates are now expected to rise, investors will not wish to lock in to lower interest rates
and will therefore sell short. Borrowers will wish to borrow at lower long-term rates to avoid
exposure to the higher rates expected in the future. These demand and supply factors will result in
a shortage of long-term funds, which will push up long-term money market rates, and to an excess
supply of short-term funds, which will lead to a reduction in short-term rates. The resulting yield
curve will be more steeply upward-sloping than the normal curve.
Falling interest rates

If there are new expectations that interest rates will fall, investors will prefer to lock in at higher
long rates, while borrowers will not wish to be committed to higher long term rates and will prefer
to borrow short. There will be an excess supply of funds at long maturities and a shortage of funds
at short maturities. This will tend to lower the yield curve, possibly resulting in a flat curve or even
in a downward-sloping curve.
Inflation

Short-term interest rates are in turn determined partly by expectations of inflation rates in the near
future. If high inflation is expected, investors will seek higher nominal rates of interest in order to
achieve a real return. If people believe that inflation is falling, then they will not require such a high
return.
